<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The Central Committee on the United Study of
Foreign Missions sends out the fourteenth text-book
with hearty appreciation of the favor with which the
thirteen already issued have been received. The phases
of work which have been treated and the manner of
their treatment have appealed to a large constituency
of various names, resulting in an increase of knowledge
and an impulse to pray and work and give.</p>

<p>This is not a book for children, but a book about
children the world over, and with its accurate statement
of facts solicits attention to the great need of
new effort in behalf of children in non-Christian lands.
The author, Mary Schauffler Labaree (Mrs. Benjamin
W.), a missionary daughter, granddaughter, wife, and
mother, was born into an environment of missionary
intelligence and activity in which her girlhood was
trained. Later years of experience in Persia, and subsequent
association with many nationalities in our
own land, have given her large opportunity to know
whereof she writes with tender, sympathetic touch.
If the book may lead others to know and do, its purpose
will be fulfilled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What do the
children need?</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="3"><a id="Page_3"></a></span>
“What do the children of India most need?”</p>

<p>The question was asked of an earnest young
teacher, at home on her first furlough. It was
easy to see how quickly her thoughts flew back
to that school for little low-caste children which
had so recently been started, and with a far-away
look in her eyes she <span class="nowrap">answered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“What the children of India need is <em>childhood</em>
itself. They are little old men and women,
and they need to learn what it means to be
happy, care-free children, to play, and to have
good times.”</p>

<p>“What do the children of Syria most need?”</p>

<p>This time it was a beautiful, young missionary
mother who answered <span class="nowrap">quickly:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The greatest need of the children in Syria is
<em>educated motherhood</em>. They are born, carried
around, and then turned loose to do as they
please as soon as they are able to toddle. It would
mean that they would be kept clean physically,
would be properly fed, taught, and trained.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="4"><a id="Page_4"></a></span>
“What is the greatest need of the children in
Persia?”</p>

<p>The answer came from a father of little children
who had himself been a missionary’s child
in Persia and knew well the country and its
needs.</p>

<p>“What Persian children need is <em>proper home
environment</em>.” A splendid Christian teacher was
talking with one of the boys of our Moslem
school about personal purity. “That is all very
well,” responded the boy, “but what do you
really expect of me with my training and home
life when my father has had one hundred and
five wives?”</p>

<p>“What do the children of America need?”</p>

<p>We turn and ask ourselves and one another
this question. And lo!&mdash;we find that the needs
of childhood are very much the same the world
around. What is being done to meet those
needs? Ah! that is a very different question,
and startling, yes, more than startling, are the
contrasts discovered as the thoughtful woman
studies the subject of child life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“The Age of
the Child.”</div>

<p>The “unity of childhood” throughout the
world makes this a vital question to all fathers
and mothers, to educators, religious and social
workers, to every thinking man and woman.
So urgent a question has it become in many
Christian lands that this has been aptly called
“the age of the child.” In our own land the
needs and rights of the child are being discussed
<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a id="Page_5"></a></span>
on every hand, and through the Public Schools,
Juvenile Courts, Juvenile Commissions, Federal
Children’s Bureau, Playground Movement, Child
Welfare Exhibits, Child Labor laws, and numerous
other agencies we are striving to deal with
the problem that involves the whole future of
our land for weal or woe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>All</em> children
must be
included.</div>

<p>But just as I cannot care for the interests of
my child alone, but must recognize that his life
will be vitally influenced by whatever concerns
his playmates and schoolmates, so I must inevitably
be drawn into consideration of what is
due to the children of the community, the state,
the country, the world. What right have I to
demand that my baby be well fed, my child be
protected by laws that ensure his safety, that
proper schools be provided for his education,
that my daughter’s purity and girlhood be
respected, unless I concede that right to every
mother in the world and <em>care</em> whether she has
that right or not?</p>

<p>One earnest mother heart poured itself out in
these words when it was planned that the women’s
missionary societies should take up the study of
the children of non-Christian <span class="nowrap">lands:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes I almost resent the absurd extremes
of tenderness and care for babies here,
when I think of the world of neglected children.
It seems to me, our Women’s Missionary Societies
are just a great, beautiful, organized motherhood
for the world, and the women don’t half
<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a id="Page_6"></a></span>
know or appreciate this or they would be swarming
in by thousands and giving their money by
millions.”</p>

<p>If any woman is tempted to feel that the
problems of our own land are so overwhelming
and so imperative as to demand all our time and
strength and attention, let her read what is
said on this subject by Edward T. Devine, the
eminent writer and professor and social worker,
who is one of the greatest leaders in all lines of
child welfare and general welfare work in America.
<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Devine links our obligations to foreign
lands inseparably to our duties to our own
country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our responsibility to foreign peoples,&mdash;our responsibility
to immigrants who come to live in America, and to
the negroes whom our own ancestors brought here by
force, our responsibility to all those who for any reason
do not fully share in that degree of prosperity and in that
type of civilization which are our heritage, thus becomes
clear and is seen to be at one with our direct personal
responsibility towards those who for any reason need our
sympathy, our fraternal co-operation, and our personal
help.<a id="Anchor-1" title="Go to Footnote 1" href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Testimony of
Alonzo Bunker.</div>

<p>Couple with the utterances quoted above such
words as the following by Alonzo Bunker, whose
faithful labors among the Karens of Burma have
worked wonders in the transformation of a race,
and it seems as though no conscientious, intelligent
man or woman would need to go further
for proof that the awakening social conscience
<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a id="Page_7"></a></span>
regarding the welfare of children in our own
land <em>must</em> include in its study and its efforts for
improvement the children of <em>all</em> lands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This unity of childhood marks the unity of the human
race, and the saying that “human nature is the same in
all the world” gains new emphasis when studied from the
standpoint of the child.</p>

<p>... These characteristics which mark the unity of
childhood among all races, sometimes appear to be accentuated
among less intelligent peoples; so that, before
the fogs of sin and ignorance have blurred the image of God
in which they were created, they show a strength and
brightness more marked than in their more favored
brothers and sisters in enlightened lands. This fact has
not received due attention in ethnological studies.<a id="Anchor-2" title="Go to Footnote 2" href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">The rights of
every child.</div>

<p><i>Every child has the inalienable right to be well-born,
to be welcomed, to be properly cared for and
trained through the years of helplessness and development,
to follow his instinct for healthful play,
to receive an education sufficient to make him a
self-supporting, useful member of society, to have
such moral and spiritual training as will develop
the highest type of character of which he is capable.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The rights of
every mother.</div>

<p><i>Every mother has the right to accept the duties,
responsibilities, and sufferings of motherhood of
her own free will, to be surrounded by such conditions
as will help her to bring her child into the
world with the greatest possible safety to her own
life and health and to those of her child, and to
loving care during her days of weakness and recuperation.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conservation
of human
resources.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="8"><a id="Page_8"></a></span>
Where the rights of mothers and children are
not thus recognized and guarded, we have a
condition that endangers the welfare of the race
and leads to its deterioration. Every nation
has looked well to the conservation of some
part of its human resources,&mdash;to its royal line,
to its soldiers or sailors, to its wise men and
astrologers, to its priests and religious leaders.</p>

<p>The well-known methods of ancient Sparta,
which consisted in destroying all weak children
and submitting all boys of seven years old and
upward to the most rigorous training under
state educators, resulted in producing a race
of warriors. Fighting men were what Sparta
wanted, and fighting men she produced. The
possible heir to a throne in modern times must
have no drop of common blood in his veins.
Royalty must therefore mate with royalty in
order to conserve the royal line. And so we
might go on and prove how one country after
another observes the great law of conservation
of human resources along some favorite line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
the children
of a nation.</div>

<p>But a nation to be truly great and to be sure
of future development and success must realize
that its greatest wealth lies in its children, its
highest possibilities are wrapped up in all its
little ones, its one hope for the future is in the
childhood of the nation. Many earnest writers
of to-day are emphasizing in one way or another
this great truth in relation to children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frederick Schoff in an address at the
<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a id="Page_9"></a></span>
National Congress on Hygiene and Demography
makes a most practical application of these
principles, showing some ways in which the
desired results may be attained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes time to battle down the old wall of belief that
mother instinct teaches a woman all she need know about
child nurture.... The great functions of fatherhood
and motherhood should not be ignored in the training
of children for life. They should be held up as the
highest and most far-reaching functions of human life....</p>

<p>“One generation, one entire generation of all the world
of children <em>understood</em> as they should be, loved as they
ask to be, and so developed as they might be, would more
than begin the millennium,” has been truly said by that
lover of childhood, Frances Hodgson Burnett.</p>

<p>Child Welfare is at the foundation of world-welfare.
Child nurture is the greatest science of the age. To
arouse the whole world to a realization of its duty to the
children ... is the propaganda in which all who see
the infinite possibilities of the child should unite.<a id="Anchor-3" title="Go to Footnote 3" href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Eugenics and
Heredity.</div>

<p>In a study of Childhood such as this, undertaken
by Christian women in their missionary
societies and mission study classes, it is not
enough to begin with the child at the day of his
birth, but we must consider also the pre-natal
influences, the history of his parents, and, in
fact, all those deep and far-reaching subjects
which are engrossing the attention of students in
America and England and on the Continent of
Europe. In studying the subjects of eugenics
and heredity, in watching the social investigator
<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a id="Page_10"></a></span>
as he shows us how from one drunken, vagabond
woman in Germany there were 834 known descendants,
the great majority of whom were
prostitutes, tramps, paupers, criminals, and
murderers, let us remember that the principles
arrived at apply with equal significance to the
future of the citizens of China and of Turkey.</p>

<p>A missionary mother from China tells us that
Chinese mothers make no preparation for the
coming of their babies because of foolish superstitions,
fearing that, if they prepare, it will
bring bad luck and the baby will die. “So,” she
continues, “Chinese mothers miss the delightful
months we American mothers consider the best
in our lives, and the babies are deprived of the
right sort of pre-natal influence.”</p>

<p>One missionary draws our attention to the
fact of the awful fears and deadly terror that
haunt the lives of so many people in India, and
asks if this may not well be the result of the
fact that their mothers are the little, shrinking,
frightened child-wives of India. “The wrongs
of Hindu womanhood in all past ages,” says
Edward Payson Tenney in his volume on “Contrasts
in Social Progress,” “have been avenged by
the propagation of a race inferior to that which
would have peopled Hindustan to-day, had the
domestic and social status of the mothers of a
great people been of a different character.”</p>

<p><abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Charles C. Selden, assistant to <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> John
G. Kerr in the Asylum for the Insane in Canton,
<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a id="Page_11"></a></span>
says that there are no statistics that will allow
comparison between the number of insane in
China and America. “If conditions are in any
particular worse in China than in America, it is
along the line of imbecility resulting from bad
heredity. Under the social ideals of China every
man is anxious to marry, but no man is permitted
to seek a wife for himself. The contract
of marriage is always made by a third party, and
often a man finds himself bound to an imbecile,
insane or chronically diseased wife whose father
has paid the marriage broker a high price to get
her a husband. There is surely a great need for
the study and practice of eugenics in China.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protection of
motherhood.</div>

<p>It is only within the last few decades that the
protection of motherhood has been recognized
in civilized lands as an economic principle. In
the protection of the mother lies the welfare of the
nation. But alas! the light of this knowledge
has not yet begun to penetrate into the darkness
of heathen and Mohammedan lands.</p>

<p>Intelligent Christian women will find much
food for thought and material for interesting
study in looking up the history of races now
extinct or those that are dying out. Trace to
their true source the reasons for the decadence
of a race and try to discover if the principles of
practical, applied Christianity, used betimes in
all their truest and most enlightened methods,
would tend to save and elevate such a race. In
Robert H. Milligan’s recent book, “The Fetish
<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a id="Page_12"></a></span>
Folk of West Africa,”<a id="Anchor-4" title="Go to Footnote 4" href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> his fourth chapter is on
“A Dying Tribe.” A few extracts will show
some of the reasons for the adjective “Dying.”</p>

<div class="sidenote2">“A Dying
Tribe.”</div>

<blockquote>

<p>This amiable and attractive people, the Mpongwe
tribe, is now but a dying remnant, hurrying to extinction.
It is not long since they were numbered by tens of thousands;
now there are probably not more than five hundred
pure Mpongwe.... The first exterminating factor was
slavery.... The slave traffic was succeeded by the rum
traffic; and it would not be easy to say which of the two
has proved the greater evil for Africa.... Except among
the few Christians, an abundance of rum is used at every
marriage and every funeral and both men and women
drink to drunkenness.... I have known of parents getting
their own children to drink to intoxication for their
amusement. It is doubtful whether there is another tribe
in all West Africa so besotted with alcoholism as the
Mpongwe. Physicians agree that it is one of the chief
causes of their increasing sterility.</p>

<p>Another factor in the extermination of the Mpongwe is
the demoralization of domestic life incident to methods
of trade.... White traders all along the coast employ
the Mpongwe as middlemen between them and the
interior people, who possess the export products. The
white man gives the middleman a certain quantity of
goods on trust. With these he goes to the interior and
establishes a small trading-post in one or several towns....
He has a wife or wives at Gaboon, and he takes to himself
a wife or two at each of his interior trading-centres....</p>

<p>This demoralization of domestic life is even worse for
the Mpongwe women than for their absent husbands.
There is a large settlement of white men in Gaboon, most
of them government officials.... Nearly all the Mpongwe
women become the mistresses of these men.... The
marriage tie in Gaboon has long ceased to be a “tie.”...
<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a id="Page_13"></a></span>
The Protestant Christians of Gaboon are a very small
community; but they are the best Christians I have
known in Africa. They alone of the Mpongwe have good-sized
families of healthy children. They are the living
remnant of a dying tribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">The sufferings
of motherhood.</div>

<p>Two outstanding facts make the experience
of motherhood in non-Christian lands a time of
almost intolerable anguish, both physical and
mental. The first of these facts is the absence
of skilful, intelligent care previous to and during
childbirth, and the second is the presence of
innumerable superstitions that envelop the mother
and her little one and the whole household.</p>

<p>It is a most interesting study to learn how
customs differ in various lands and swing to
extremes, from Persia, where the time of childbirth
is the occasion for a large neighborhood
gathering of women and children, to certain
regions of China, where we are told that there
is an absolute interdict on seeing mother or child
for forty days after the birth, and during that
time many and many a little one mysteriously
disappears, never to be heard of again. In
China the mother who loses her life before being
able to give birth to her child is consigned by
popular opinion to the very lowest hell, which
is said to be reserved for the worst criminals.
In a large Buddhist temple on a hill outside
of Ningpo hangs a huge bronze bell, over which
are tied numberless bunches of hair of women
who have died in childbirth. When the bell is
<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a id="Page_14"></a></span>
rung, the motion is supposed to pull the poor
women out of the place of punishment. Among
the Lao a woman dying in childbirth is not
allowed to be cremated, for her death is supposed
to have been caused by evil spirits and the
victim is blamed and is not deemed worthy of
cremation wherein is <em>merit</em>. These suffering
mothers feel as if an angel from heaven had come
to their aid, when the loving face of a missionary
physician stoops over them, and her skilful
hands minister to their needs. A few words by
<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> E. M. Stuart of the Church Missionary
Society, at work in Ispahan, Persia, give a vivid
picture of the need for women physicians and
nurses to do this work,&mdash;a need that exists not
only in Mohammedan harems, but in the zenanas
of India and in the homes of other lands where
women live in seclusion.</p>

  <img src="images/bedouin.jpg" width="475" height="600" alt="" title=""/>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smallcaps">How Bedouin Mothers Carry Their Babies</span></p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>In every Moslem land there are countless lives lost
every year from lack of skilled assistance when it is sorely
needed.... This work calls specially for women-doctors
and nurses, for though Moslem women will consent to see
men-doctors for many of their ailments, and will even crowd
out the men-patients at dispensaries taken by male
doctors, very few will allow a man to give them the
assistance they need in difficult labour; were even the
women themselves willing, it is very uncommon for the
husbands and other male relations to consent to it. As
a rule they would rather the women died than allow a man
to interfere; the only comfort they give them is the assurance
of the Prophet that women who die in childbirth
go straight to Paradise.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Superstitions
regarding newborn
infants.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="15"><a id="Page_15"></a></span>
There is scarcely a land outside the pale of
Christian civilization where the newborn infant
is not surrounded by absurd, painful, or distressing
ceremonies because of superstitions that
may not be ignored, the “Evil Eye” that must
be averted, or ceremonies that are to be observed
because handed down from generation to
generation. One of the most astonishing and
picturesque of these observances is described by
the Swiss missionary, Henri A. Junod, in his
careful study of “The Life of a South African
Tribe.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second act is the <em>rite of the broken pot</em>.... This is a
medical treatment and a religious ceremony combined.
It is performed by the family doctor on the threshold of
the hut in the following way: He puts into this piece of
broken pottery pieces of skin of all the beasts of the bush:
antelopes, wild cats, elephants, hippopotami, rats, civet
cats, hyenas, elands, snakes of dangerous kinds; and
roasts them till they burn. The smoke then rises, and
he exposes the child to it for a long time, the body, face,
nose, mouth. The baby begins to cry; he sneezes, he
coughs; it is just what is wanted; then the doctor takes
what remains of the pieces of skin, grinds them, makes
a powder, mixes it with tihuhlu grease of the year before
last, and consequently hard enough to make an ointment.
With this ointment he rubs the whole body of the child,
especially the joints, which he extends gently in order
to assist the baby’s growth.</p>

<p>All this fumigation and manipulation is intended to
act as a preventive. Having been so exposed to all the
external dangers, dangers which are represented by the
beasts of the bush, the child may go out of the hut. He
is now able “to cross the foot-prints of wild beasts”
<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a id="Page_16"></a></span>
without harm.... This rite of the broken pot is also
the great preventive remedy against the much dreaded
ailment of babies, convulsions.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">The Evil Eye.</div>

<p>From land to land you may travel, through
Africa, Asia, and the Islands of the Pacific, and
all the poor little babies and their older brothers
and sisters will be found to be victims of superstitions
that surround and hamper and often
injure their pitiful little lives. The Evil Eye,&mdash;oh!
how it is feared and how every possible and
impossible means is used to avert it. You must
not think of openly admiring a Mohammedan
baby, or of wearing anything black on your head
when making your first call upon it, for you
would certainly cast the Evil Eye on it. A
Maronite woman in the Lebanon mountains,
Syria, had lost a baby three or four weeks old,&mdash;her
first baby boy. She told a missionary that
the child had died because while he was sick they
opened an egg, and found therein an eye (the
life-germ) and that was the Evil Eye which had
killed the child.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teething.</div>

<p>“Children in Nyago, Africa,” we read in a
Church Missionary Society report, “receive the
tribal mark by being branded on their foreheads
with a hot iron. Some of the front teeth are
extracted as soon as the child can speak.” The
teething period as well as every other part of a
child’s life has to be safe-guarded from malicious
influences. For instance, a child of the Thonga
Tribe in South Africa has a white bead tied to a
<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a id="Page_17"></a></span>
hair about the forehead as soon as it has cut the
two upper and lower incisors, for, unless this is
done, there is no hope that the child will become
intelligent; he would shiver instead of smiling,
and the other teeth would not come out normally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil spirits
“driven out” by
the missionary.</div>

<p>Thank God that there are sometimes missionaries
near at hand who have won the love and
confidence of the mothers and who are allowed
to “drive out the evil spirits” by means of applied
Christianity, common sense, and cleverness.
Here is an example of all three means used for a
baby on the borders of Pigmy Land.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One morning a woman brought down to the dispensary
a wee morsel of three weeks; it was a pitiful little object
of mere skin and bone. The mother explained that it
had been poisoned out of spite, or it was possessed of an
evil spirit. “See,” said she, “I have done all I could to
let out the poison or devil.” Looking at its body I saw
it was covered with a number of small, deep cuts, and the
blood had been left to dry. Low moans and a tired cry
came from the poor, little, helpless mite as the flies tortured
its mutilated body. After questioning the mother the
“evil spirit” took the form of bananas and mushrooms,
on which she had been bringing up the three weeks’ infant!
Feeding bottles were an unknown luxury, and, as no
equivalent had been invented, babies were compelled
to lap from the hand, an art they never properly learned
and thrived on very poorly. Some three dozen india
rubber “comforters” were sent out to me, and these I
managed to fix on empty ink bottles or medicine bottles,
and so a new fashioned “Allenbury feeder” was introduced.
The demand far exceeded the supply, so they could only
be lent out by the month.<a id="Anchor-5" title="Go to Footnote 5" href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Superstitions
regarding twins.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a id="Page_18"></a></span>
Strangely enough the birth of twins seems to
be regarded with horror or disgust, or at least
as a misfortune, in almost all lands where Christ,
the Lover of children, is not known. In some
parts of Africa the little twin babies are stuffed
into a pot and thrown into the woods to die,
and their mother is considered disgraced for life
or sent into exile. A missionary of the Church
Missionary Society of London tells us that in
West Africa the idea is that by the law of God
human births should be single; therefore, if a
mother has twins, she has been degraded to the
level of a beast, the children are also beasts, and
their death is necessary in order to preserve the
human race pure and to prevent misfortune.
Japanese fathers will not let a little child look
into a mirror and see its double, for fear that
when grown it will be unfortunate enough to
have twins!</p>

<p>As there is no phase of life that Christian
missions cannot touch and change, so among
some of the African West Coast tribes, as the
people have learned of Christianity, twin murder
has been abandoned along with human sacrifice,
though even harder to eradicate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infanticide.</div>

<p>Were twin murder alone prevalent among non-Christian
races, it would be reason enough for
earnest effort and prayer on the part of every
Christian mother in the world until it could be
stamped out. But the crime of infanticide is
so frightfully prevalent in China, India, and
<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a id="Page_19"></a></span>
the Pacific Islands that it is a loud challenge to
Christian parents to bring into darkened hearts
and homes the knowledge of Him who considered
it a capital offense even to “cause one of these
little ones to stumble.”</p>

<p>In very few cases do we read of infanticide
being practiced at the present time on boy babies.
Twin murder as mentioned above, the killing in
Central Africa of “monstrosities” who have been
born with a tooth cut, or who cut their upper
teeth first, and the putting away of illegitimate
children among some Mohammedans, seem to be
almost the only exceptions to this rule. The
poor little girl babies, not wanted, not welcomed,
considered a disgrace and an expense, must
again and again pay the penalty for being girls
with their lives.</p>

<p>“Why should the girl live?” the Pacific Islander
would say to the early missionaries, “She cannot
poise the spear, she cannot wield the club.”<a id="Anchor-6" title="Go to Footnote 6" href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of
infanticide in
India.</div>

<p><abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> E. Storrow has made a careful study of
the causes of infanticide in India, and his conclusions
are worthy of our attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our knowledge, at the best imperfect, is confined to the
present century, the period of British supremacy.</p>

<p>Three causes have led to <span class="nowrap">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Great moral laxity, combined with indifference to
infantine life, and a desire to conceal wrong doing, which
the privacy of native habits renders comparatively easy.</p>

<p>2. Religious fanaticism has led to the crime in restricted
areas....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="20"><a id="Page_20"></a></span>
3. But infanticide, springing out of disappointment
at the birth of girls, because of their assumed inferiority
to boys, the lowering of the family repute, and the inevitable
expense demanded by usage on their marriage,
chiefly requires our attention; because it grew into a
system which was hardly concealed, and became prevalent
in Rajputana, Gujarat, Cutch, and other great
districts in Central and Western India....</p>

<p>The little ones were usually destroyed immediately
after birth.... The reasons for such a usage, widely established
among such people, and perpetuated through
many generations, are worthy of close attention.</p>

<p>Cruelty is not a Hindu characteristic.... But the people
are callous and apathetic. They would not deliberately
inflict suffering and take pleasure in it, but they would
not move hand or foot to rescue such as were greatly
suffering.... This goes far to explain the unchallenged
prevalence for ages of such atrocities as suttee and infanticide....</p>

<p>“A mother of sons” is one of the highest compliments
that can be paid to a wife; “a mother of daughters” is
one of the most contemptuous and scornful of all terms of
reproach. This explains the gladness with which the
birth of sons is welcomed, the disappointment manifest
at the birth of daughters, and the disposition to put
them away....</p>

<p>But whilst these were the causes generally operative,
there were two special ones, which were influential among
the haughty, high-caste Rajputs and kindred tribes&mdash;the
difficulty of procuring suitable husbands for their
daughters, when the customary age for marriage arrived;
with the supposed disgrace of having unmarried daughters,
and the difficulty of defraying the heavy expenses which
usage demands....</p>

<p>Happily, the crime is abating through the persistent
action of the government, and yet more because of that
great wave of renewed opinion and sentiment passing
<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a id="Page_21"></a></span>
over the people. But that this crime is yet frequent,
and the law evaded, is evident.<a id="Anchor-7" title="Go to Footnote 7" href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was there a dry eye in the auditorium at
Northfield when Mrs. James Cochran, only a
few weeks before her death, told of the little girl
babies in China who are thrown out to die? All
could feel the throbbing love of her mother heart
as she told the story in such simple words to the
hundreds of young women gathered before her.
Who among them could ever again be guiltless
if she did not do her share towards saving the
baby girls of China? Listen to her words:<a id="Anchor-8" title="Go to Footnote 8" href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Confucianism wants no little girls, for they are of no
use. It is very nice to have one or two, but in the part
of China from which I come it is absolutely a custom, if
there are more than two or three, to murder the others
in some horrible way. One night one of my pupils
came to my class very soberly. At first she whispered
to the women about her and then they began to whisper
to each other. Finally I inquired the reason. One of the
women replied, “She is feeling badly because they are
killing a little baby down at her house.”</p>

<p>“Killing a little baby!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the girl replied, “they have three little girls and
another girl has just come. I feel so badly because she
is a dear, fat, little baby. I did not want to see her die,
but my sister is determined to kill her.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “you go and bring that baby to me. I
can take care of her.”</p>

<p>So she went, but before she arrived the baby had been
murdered in a way too dreadful to tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Bathing of
children.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="22"><a id="Page_22"></a></span>
It is rather entertaining to pick up, one after
another, books and magazine articles written
for children about the children of missionary
lands, and to find them all starting out with the
proposition, “Children are very much the same
the world around.” How are we going to
reconcile this statement with the fact that some
children survive and even thrive upon treatment
that would mean certain death to others? What
would happen to the little American baby first
opening his eyes on the world, if he were taken
out of doors as the babies are in Central Africa
between four and five o’clock in the morning,
when the cold night winds are still abroad, and
cold water were dashed over him, and he were
left naked out there to dry? The cold water
treatment of the Africans and the Lao differs
widely from the baths of little ones in Japan
where the water must be nearly boiling hot to
be of the proper temperature. But in Persia it
would be sure death to a newborn baby to be
bathed at all,&mdash;he must be carefully rubbed with
salt as were the properly-cared-for infants of
Ezekiel’s time! (<abbr title="Ezekiel">Ez.</abbr> 16:4.) Then into a cradle
he is not laid, but strapped, wound round and
round until his little legs and arms are rigid and
immovable, and the soft bones of the back of his
head are flattened as he lies there day after day.
Oh, how we long to pick him up and let him
change places occasionally with one of the imperial
babies of Japan, who must be held in
<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a id="Page_23"></a></span>
some one’s arms day and night from the time of
his birth until he can walk. But no, there he
must lie, and, in order that he may not take
cold and fall a victim to that dangerous enemy,
fresh air, over the ridgepole of the cradle are
thrown various coverings, most of which hang
to the floor. A missionary told me that once
when she wanted to look at a Syrian baby, she
took off four blankets which had been thrown over
the whole cradle, and then removed a Turkish
towel folded double over the child’s face.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clothing of
children.</div>

<p>It is strange to learn in how many lands the
mothers feel that they must wrap and tie and
bind and swathe their babies until they are
deprived of all power of motion, and lives and
health are sadly endangered by too much rather
than too little clothing. The Chinese mother
dresses her baby in a tiny wadded jacket, then
another, then another, saying perhaps, “It is
five jackets cold to-day.” He is wrapped and
tied up until the bundle with a baby at the centre
can be rolled on the floor without hurting him,
or may perchance act as a life-preserver if he
falls off the houseboat into the canal. It is
pretty sure to keep afloat until it can be pulled
in with a boat hook.</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/cradle.jpg" width="600" height="490" alt="" title=""/>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smallcaps">A Persian Baby in His Cradle</span></p>
</div>

<p>Very differently clad are the “Coral Island
Brownies” or the babies of Africa, who are not
hampered with any clothes at all, and as they
grow older simply wear a fringe of grass or a
strip of calico about their waists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="24"><a id="Page_24"></a></span>
It is easy to trace many of the cases of terrible
eye disease among children in Egypt, Syria, and
other warm countries to the utter lack of any
protection to the eyes from the glaring sunlight.
Often boat women are seen rowing in the bright
sunlight in China with babies asleep on their
backs, and nothing over the sensitive little eyes
as their heads bob up and down in time with the
oars.</p>

<p>It is often a great shock to the American missionary
mother to see little heads wrapped and
swathed in numerous cloths and kerchiefs, while
the little feet are blue with cold. But then, the
shock is reciprocal, and, while the mother is
off conducting a meeting, her nurse is carefully
making up for her negligence by wrapping up
the head of the missionary baby until he is
bathed in perspiration!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infant
mortality.</div>

<p>The study of Infant Mortality is now engrossing
the thought and attention of many earnest men
and women. It is most difficult to get vital
statistics from any non-Christian lands in order
to give comparative tables. In comparing the
mortality statistics of the United States for 1890
and 1909 we find marked improvement in the
“opportunity for life and health” granted to
American children. If George B. Mangold is
right in saying that “the infant and child mortality
of a people is a barometer of their social
progress,” then we have reason to believe that
our land is making real advance in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="25"><a id="Page_25"></a></span>
In 1890 the total number of deaths of children
under five years was 307,562; in 1909 the total
number of deaths of children under five years
was 196,534.</p>

<p>From the first mortality table of the principal
cities of the world in 1912 that has been made
public we learn that&mdash;</p>

<table class="plain_tab" summary="mortality">
<tr><td>Stockholm</td>
    <td class="cent">has</td>

<p>Contrast with these figures the following,
based upon careful study and research by high
<span class="nowrap">authorities:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It is by no means improbable that more than
half the whole number of Chinese children die
before they are two years old.” (Arthur H.
Smith.)</p>

<p>In Syria the infant mortality is 75% of the
births.</p>

<p>In Persia the infant mortality is 85% of the
births.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the National Association for
the Prevention of Infant Mortality in Great
Britain, the Right Honorable John Burns,
<abbr title="Privy Council, Member of Parliament">P. C., M. P.</abbr>, speaking on “Infant Life Protection”
gave many interesting facts and figures to show
how infant mortality is being decreased in Great
Britain through scientific and systematic efforts
along many lines. One sentence is significant:</p>

<p>“Let me decide the food, the home, and the
condition of life of every child from birth to
<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a id="Page_26"></a></span>
seven years of age, and the rest of mankind can
do with the children after seven years of age
what they like.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feeding of
children.</div>

<p>Constant and increasing attention is being
paid in these days to the proper feeding of children,
to the study of dietetics, to the preparation
of suitable food for infants, and to the proper
intervals for administering the food. Any mother
of average intelligence in our land may secure
one of the carefully prepared books such as <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Holt’s on “The Care and Feeding of Children,”
or the smaller leaflets such as “What Children
Should Eat,” and by making a study of them and
of her child may hope to see that it is well and
properly nourished. But what chance is there
for the mother in Asia or Africa who, even if
she cares to learn, has no means of knowing how
to feed her child properly?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ignorant
mothers.</div>

<p>I was making a call of condolence on a neighbor
in Persia who had just buried a dearly loved
baby, the fourth or fifth she had lost. With
such a pathetic look she said, “It seems as if we
did not know how to care for our babies. You
missionaries take such beautiful care of yours.”
A wonderful opening, by the way, for starting a
mothers’ meeting at which we used to discuss
the care and training of our little ones. A
mother arrived early one meeting day to tell
me, “I tried on my children what you suggested
last week, <em>and it worked</em>.”</p>

<p>Quite different was this set of mothers who
<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a id="Page_27"></a></span>
had long been in contact with the missionaries,
from the mother in a Persian village who begged
a missionary to put a cent on her baby’s head and
write a prayer that it might not die as six others
had done in that family. The missionary replied
with some severity that it was much more to
the purpose to have the mother learn to take
proper care of it, for the baby was not yet a
year old and she was feeding it with meat and
fruit.</p>

<p>In most if not all of the non-Christian lands
whose child life we are studying there seems to
be the tendency to two extremes. The children
are often nursed by the mother for two, three,
five, or even more years, and at the same time
they are allowed to eat anything that their fancy
dictates or that they can get hold of. Mrs. Noyes
of China says that if the mother has no milk she
cannot afford to buy canned milk, and of course
fresh milk is entirely out of her reach. So she
chews rice most carefully until it is soft and
mushy, then takes it from her own mouth and
puts it, germs and all, into the baby’s mouth.
This diet is supplemented with rich cakes and
the inevitable tea. Another missionary tells us
that, if a child in China is ill, his appetite is
tempted by rich, heavy food or fruit, and adds,
“the mortality of children is frightful.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">An unwholesome
diet.</div>

<p>Mrs. Underwood, an experienced mother and
physician who has lived and worked many years
in Korea, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="28"><a id="Page_28"></a></span>
Every imaginable practice which comes under the
definition of unhygienic or unsanitary is common. Even
young children in arms eat raw and green cucumbers,
unpeeled, acrid berries, and heavy, soggy bread. They
bolt quantities of hot or cold rice, with a tough, indigestible
cabbage, washed in ditch water, prepared with
turnips, and flavored with salt and red pepper. Green
fruit of every kind is eaten with perfect recklessness of all
the laws of nature, and with impunity....</p>

<p>But even these, so to speak, galvanized-iron interiors are
not always proof. It takes time, but every five or six
years, by great care and industry, a bacillus develops
itself ... and then there is an epidemic of cholera.<a id="Anchor-9" title="Go to Footnote 9" href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is one of the most difficult lessons to impress
on those who have become Christians that
true Christianity, lived out to its logical conclusion,
includes all that proper physical care of
the child which, with the right mental and
spiritual training, shall prepare it to take its
place in the world.</p>

<p><abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Exner, recently in physical educational
work in the <abbr title="Young Men’s Christian Association">Y. M. C. A.</abbr> at Shanghai, <span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hygiene and
the child problem.</div>

<p>“The need of the knowledge of hygiene has
a very definite bearing on the child problem.
Thousands upon thousands of children are killed
simply for the lack of knowledge of the simplest
elements of feeding and care. To illustrate:
A well educated Chinese teacher, graduate of a
mission school, fed his five months’ old daughter
a piece of rich cake. It developed intestinal
<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a id="Page_29"></a></span>
trouble from which it died in spite of expert
medical care. When I expressed my sympathy,
he said, ‘Well, it is the Lord’s will.’ I added
to myself, ‘You should know better!’”</p>

<p>How much easier it is to say piously, “It is
the Lord’s will,” than to take trouble and bear
expense and lay aside age-long custom and
prejudice in order that little ones may live!
But we must not judge too harshly when we
remember how long it has taken more enlightened
lands to learn the great value of the lives
of the children and how to care for these lives.
Rather should we be all the more ready to send
and carry to them the light and knowledge that
have come to us. Then there will be fewer such
scenes as one missionary mother witnessed in
Syria. It was in a Jewish family where there
were four little girls. The baby was a mass
of sores from head to foot, and the missionary
physician said that they were merely the result
of mal-nutrition. But the mother said that her
husband was utterly unwilling to buy a little
milk each day,&mdash;“It is not worth while, for she
is only another little girl.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Special work
for missionary
mothers.</div>

<p>It is a most legitimate and absolutely essential
part of missionary work,&mdash;and not one of the
easiest tasks, either,&mdash;to teach parents that
“children intelligently fed during infancy, childhood,
and youth may hope for normal health in
adult life, with natural physical strength, endurance,
buoyancy.” Here is a special field of
<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a id="Page_30"></a></span>
labor for missionary mothers, who have this
advantage over physicians and teachers that they
can teach by object lessons which <em>always</em> make
a deeper impression than exhortation or verbal
instruction. Of course the missionary mother
often has the great handicap of an adverse climate
in which to bring up her child. But her
intelligent application of the principles she should
learn in order to fit <em>her</em> for motherhood, and
her willingness to teach these principles to the
ignorant mothers so interested in all that pertains
to the little foreign baby, may be some of
the greatest factors in the future welfare, stamina,
and development of great nations such as
China and India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Children starving.</div>

<p>Which is more harmful to a child, reckless,
indiscriminate over-feeding or under-feeding and
starvation diet? In lands swept periodically by
famine or flood or devastated by war and massacre,
there are thousands of little children who
literally starve to death while other thousands
continue to exist,&mdash;but what an existence it is!
How can it but have its evil effect on the mind
and morals of a child as well as on its physical
well-being to be deprived of proper or sufficient
nourishment during the years of growth and
development? If child welfare is the legitimate,
rightful responsibility of every Christian woman,
then it behooves us to see that such scenes as
the following cease to be possible anywhere in
the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="31"><a id="Page_31"></a></span>
One mother, a widow with four children dependent
on her, told me, with tears streaming down her face, how
she had tried to throw away the skeleton-like little baby
she carried in her arms, but she said the child always found
its way back to her, and she added, “It is not easy to give
one’s own child away.” She said she felt sometimes
she would just have to drink poison, and put an end to
her miserable existence, and one of the others asked her
what would become of her children if she did that, and
she said, with despair in every feature, “Don’t ask me.”<a id="Anchor-10" title="Go to Footnote 10" href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a later chapter we shall learn of what is
being done through Christian orphanages for
many little famine waifs and the orphans of
those killed in battle and massacre, but, when
we consider the untold harm to body and mind
that has befallen these children before help
reaches them, we realize that we must hereafter
work with heart and soul at the task of <em>prevention</em>
of these great evils if we believe in the welfare
of the human race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health.</div>

<p>“Health,” we are told by <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> E. T. Devine,
“is influenced by the occupations and habits of
growing children; by their play and their attendance
at school; by the attention given to
their eyesight, hearing, breathing, and digestion,
to their spines, and to the arches of their feet,
to their position at the desk, and to the type from
which their text books are printed; by the
readiness with which they make friends and so
enter into the natural sports and exercises of
<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a id="Page_32"></a></span>
childhood; by the development of their self-control,
and their more or less unconscious
acceptance of standards of conduct and principles
of action which will be their ultimate safeguard
against those diseases and weaknesses
which come from indulgence of wrong appetites
and desires.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foot-binding.</div>

<p>Judged by these standards, what chances
have the children of Asia and Africa and the
Pacific Islands for being safeguarded against
disease and weakness and death? Consider the
one matter of “attention to the arches of their
feet” and compare such a standard of health
with the age-long custom of foot-binding in
China, and what hope is there for perfect,
blooming health among the women of China or
their children? A full description of the horrible
custom of foot-binding may be found in <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
James S. Dennis’s “Christian Missions and Social
Progress” (<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 212). The effects of it
upon the little girl victims are thus described by
one who has every right to speak on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Archibald Little, whose position as president of
the Natural-feet Society has given her special reason for
investigating, says in her book, “Intimate China”: “During
the first three years (of foot-binding) the girlhood of
China presents a most melancholy spectacle. Instead
of a hop, skip, and a jump, with rosy cheeks like the
little girls of England, the poor little things are leaning
heavily on a stick somewhat taller than themselves, or
carried on a man’s back, or sitting sadly crying. They
have great black lines under their eyes, and a special curious
<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a id="Page_33"></a></span>
paleness that I have never seen except in connection
with foot-binding. Their mothers sleep with a big stick
by the bedside, with which to get up and beat the little
girl should she disturb the household by her wails; but
not uncommonly she is put to sleep in an outhouse.
The only relief she gets is either from opium, or from
hanging her feet over the edge of her wooden bedstead, so
as to stop the circulation. The Chinese saying is, “For
each pair of bound feet there has been a whole kang, or
big bath, full of tears.” And they say that one girl out
of ten dies of foot-binding or its after-effects.”<a id="Anchor-11" title="Go to Footnote 11" href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the changes that are sweeping over
China, the Anti-foot-binding Movement ranks
high in importance. It is receiving daily impetus
by reason of all the new things Chinese
women and girls want to do, which are impossible
to accomplish unless they can walk instead of
hobble. When this movement has really conquered
the custom and “fashion” of centuries,
there will be a better health report from the girls
of China.</p>

<p>Utter carelessness or ignorance of the first
principles of cleanliness is responsible for much
ill-health and death. A “swat-the-fly campaign”
would save thousands of unprotected baby faces
from being covered with loathsome disease or
disfigured with dangerous eye trouble, but it
would encounter not only hopeless inertia,&mdash;it
would arouse serious religious opposition. In
some countries the “sacredness of life” means,&mdash;Protect
the fly, no matter what happens to the
baby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical practice
in non-Christian
lands.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="34"><a id="Page_34"></a></span>
One subject, upon which <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Devine has not
touched in his list given above, is the necessity
for the protection of well children from contagious
diseases, and of skilful, tender care of the sick.
We might easily fill a chapter with the study of
so-called “medical practice” as conducted in
non-Christian lands,&mdash;a practice composed largely
of mingled superstition, ignorance, cruelty, and
avarice&mdash;but a few pages on the subject in addition
to our earlier study of what takes place at
the time of childbirth will suffice, we trust, to
make earnest Christian women desire to study
it further. It is easy to shrink from contemplating
the sufferings of innocent children, and
many a woman is tempted to say, “I am too
sensitive, I cannot hear about such things.”
But are we more sensitive than the little, shrinking,
pitiful children to whom these things happen
daily? Therefore, not to encourage morbid
curiosity, but in order that as Christian mothers
and sisters we may lift the burden from little
shoulders unable to bear it, let us fearlessly face
the facts as they are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contagious
diseases.</div>

<p>The frightful ravages made by smallpox,
diphtheria, scarlet fever, and even the milder
“children’s diseases,” such as measles and whooping-cough,
often devastate whole towns and carry
away the larger part of the children in a community.
Smallpox, for instance, is so common
in Korea that it is not considered worth while to
try to escape it. It is caused by the visit of a
<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a id="Page_35"></a></span>
very great and honored spirit, and while he remains
the children are addressed in high sounding
terms in honor of their great guest. When he
is about ready to return to the south land, <i>i.e.</i>,
when the child has nearly recovered, a feast is
made in honor of the visitor and he is provided
with a wooden horse for his journey.</p>

<p>On an itinerating journey in Korea <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> and
Mrs. Underwood with their little boy stopped
at a village called Pak Chun and had a rather
disturbing experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just before leaving, I saw a child quite naked, covered
with smallpox pustules in full bloom, standing near our
door. I asked one of the natives if there was much of
that disease in the village at present. “In every house,”
was the concise reply. “Why, there is none in the house
we are in,” said I with confidence. “Oh, no, they took
the child out the day you came in order to give you the
room,” was the reassuring answer. We had eaten and
slept in that infected little room, our blankets all spread
out there, our trunks opened, everything we had exposed.
We had even used their cooking utensils and spoons and
bowls before our own packs had arrived. For ourselves
we had been often exposed, and believed ourselves immune.
Mr. Underwood had nursed a case of the most malignant
type, and I had been in contact with it among my patients,&mdash;but
our child! So we sent a swift messenger with a
despatch to the nearest telegraph station, twenty-four
hours away, to <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Wells, in Pyeng Yang. He at once
put a tube of virus into the hands of a speedy runner,
who arrived with it a week later.</p>

<p>We found the country full of smallpox, measles, and
whooping-cough, and added to our smallpox experience
an exactly similar one with measles.<a id="Anchor-12" title="Go to Footnote 12" href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="36"><a id="Page_36"></a></span>
The loud death wail goes up from a village
home in Persia where a little life has been snatched
away by diphtheria. Instantly every mother in
the village seizes her baby and the next-to-the-youngest
toddles after, and all gather in the family
room of the little mud home, where the body
lies, and show their sympathy by adding their
voices to the general din. Fortunately custom
decrees that burial take place as speedily as
possible, but the mischief has already been
done, and echoes of the death wail are heard from
far and near.</p>

<p>Call over the roll of physicians of your own
Board. A wonderful report it would be if each
could respond and give the number of epidemics
through which he or she has worked unflinchingly,
bringing hope and comfort and life to
hundreds and thousands stricken down not only
by the diseases already mentioned but by typhus,
cholera, and plague. Call the roll of the countries
where no law demands isolation or precautions
of any kind, and one after another
would respond, if it could, in terms of loving
gratitude to missionaries who have introduced or
freely used vaccine, anti-toxin, cholera serum,
and other products of medical science. Many
lands are now awaking to the possibility and
desirability of using preventive measures, and
vaccination, for instance, is very prevalent in
China. It is good to hear <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Estella Perkins
of China say, after an epidemic of scarlet fever,
<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a id="Page_37"></a></span>
“I must say, however, that these young mothers
have been very obedient to orders. I know by
the number of dispensary cases of sequelae in
patients I did not treat, that the careful following
of directions by the mothers of my children
must have saved half of them from bad results
of the disease. It is a comfort to be able to
do something more than prescribe a little medicine.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cruel treatment
of sick
children.</div>

<p>We spoke above of the ignorance, cruelty, superstition,
and avarice that compose so largely the
medical practice of the Orient. Disease is very
frequently considered the work of an evil spirit
which must either be appeased by offerings or
driven out by harsh and cruel treatment. And
so the tender little bodies are branded with hot
irons, pierced by needles, or burned with rags
dipped in oil and set on fire. While the little
one suffers, a witch doctor may be called in to
use his incantations, or the mother may take a
little rag from some article of the child’s clothing
and tie it to a sacred tree already covered with
hundreds of these rags, or the string of beads or
the entrails of a beast are consulted to see if the
omen is favorable for administering medicine.
Let me give just one case from Central Africa
which can be duplicated many times over from
the records of other lands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an example let me give the case of a lad who was
suffering from tuberculosis. He had consulted the witch
doctor, and after having paid his fee was told that he had
<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a id="Page_38"></a></span>
been poisoned. Whereupon the “surgeon” drew his
knife out from his belt and made a number of small incisions.
He then declared he could see the poison inside
the youth, and took it away. But the lad was not cured,
and so came down to give the European’s wisdom a trial.<a id="Anchor-13" title="Go to Footnote 13" href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Christian help
for sick children.</div>

<p>Thank God, there is a brighter side to the
story. In the name of the little Child of Bethlehem
the little children of sorrow and darkness
and suffering are being reached and helped and
cured and loved. In many a mission hospital
and many a humble home the blind are receiving
sight, the crooked limbs are being straightened,
the burning fever is checked, the hollow cheeks
are growing round and rosy. The last word picture
of this chapter shall be from the pen of Mrs.
Gerald F. Dale, the mother-saint who presides
over the women’s and children’s hospitals in
Beirut, Syria.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Children’s
Pavilion,
Beirut.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The Children’s Pavilion is the arena which calls into
play the whole gamut of one’s emotions. Such poor,
wasted faces; such robust, jolly faces; so much pain;
so much fun; twisted limbs before operation, straight
ones after; noses and mouths cobbled and mended, a
stitch here, a fold there, and what a change! It requires
the standpoint of the East to unravel the full meaning of
little Hindiyeh’s exclamation, who, gazing in admiration
at her straightened legs, looked up with a merry laugh
and said: “Curse the religion of the father of my legs
as they used to be!” A baby-boy was to have no say
in the matter of his poor crumpled-up little club-feet,
for the mother begged that only one might be straightened,
in order to save him from military service in the future....
The children’s favorite game is “operations,” the patient
<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a id="Page_39"></a></span>
being in turn a real child or a doll. Everything is reproduced
to the life. A pin stuck into the doll’s mouth is a
thermometer; sawdust stuffing makes a most realistic
draining wound; bits of wire and gauze are twisted into
a mask, and chloroform is poured from an empty spool.
The scientific bandaging of head, legs, and arms shows
how intently the little brains have observed. They are
busy with other things too; hymn after hymn is learned,
the commandments, verses, psalms.</p>

<p>Everything that is dropped into these receptive minds
stays, and once there will be shared, who can tell by how
many? It is the little child who shall lead, and it is the
<em>handful</em> of corn whose fruit shall shake like Lebanon.<a id="Anchor-14" title="Go to Footnote 14" href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h3>QUOTATIONS</h3>

<h4>CHILDBIRTH&mdash;CHINA</h4>

<p>Mary V. Glenton, Wuchang, China, writes in the
<cite>Spirit of Missions</cite> for July, 1902:</p>

<p>Recently I was called to a case of childbirth away out in
the country. My native assistant had asked for a holiday;
she had gone that morning. After a long ride in
the chair through country roads, past the pagoda, I was
ushered into a small house of two rooms and then into
one of these rooms to my patient. When I shut the door
to keep the crowd out, and had thrown water out the
window several times for the same purpose, ineffectually,
<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a id="Page_40"></a></span>
I found that I must have some light and also some air;
so I stationed one chair coolie at the door and another at
the window, and started in. I had to give chloroform
myself, as well as do the rest of the work. But after
four hours’ hard work, so hard that while my feet were
cold on the earth floor (it was February), the upper part
of my body was in profuse perspiration, I got through,
and saved the woman’s life.</p>

<p>Immediately there arose a most tumultuous screaming,
shrieking, stamping, calling, flapping doors back and
forth on their hinges, and any sort of noise that could be
made. I had never heard such a din in my life. What
was coming I could not imagine. I was miles away from
home; it was growing dark; I had no one with me,
whom I knew or could reason with, but the chair coolies,
one of whom was a mere boy, the other a perfect goose,
who thinks himself unusually intelligent. I managed to
make myself heard after a while, enough to ask what they
were doing, and found that all the din and racket were to
frighten away the spirit of the dead baby that had just
been born.</p>


<h4>MOHAMMEDAN BABIES AND CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS</h4>

<p>During the Balkan War a number of Bulgarian soldiers
came into a village which had been deserted by the
Turks, and there they found eight little Turkish babies
who had been left behind,&mdash;girls of course. They were
in a dreadful condition, but the tender heart of one of the
soldiers could not bear to leave them so. He found a
tub, and they undressed the babies, bathed them, and,
taking some cloth from a store, bound them all up again
in Oriental fashion. The tiny ladies, being very hungry,
continued to cry. The dilemma was how to find food
for these eight babies, all under a year of age. The
kind-hearted Bulgarian was equal to the emergency.
Dispatching one of his comrades to a neighboring village
<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a id="Page_41"></a></span>
for some milk, he proceeded to kill eight geese. Removing
and cleaning the crops from these, he filled them with
the milk, using goose quills for nipples, and soon the
eight babies were fast asleep. Then they sent them on
into Bulgaria to be cared for, with greetings from Turkey.</p>

<p>(Told by Mrs. E. E. Count of the Methodist Episcopal
Mission in Bulgaria.)</p>


<h3>BIBLE READING</h3>

<p class="mem">
“What manner of Child shall this be?” Luke 1:5&ndash;14, 57&ndash;66, 80.</p>

<p>The little child greatly longed for&mdash;promised by God’s
messenger&mdash;rejoiced over at birth&mdash;named “Jehovah is
gracious,” not according to custom but with peculiar
significance&mdash;grew in stature&mdash;waxed strong in spirit&mdash;God’s
hand was with him.</p>

<p>“When I see a child he inspires me with two feelings:
tenderness for what he is now, respect for what he may
become hereafter.” Louis Pasteur.</p>


<h3>PRAYER</h3>

<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, we beseech Thee, by the innocence
and obedience of Thy Holy childhood, guard the children
of this our land and of all lands; preserve their innocence,
strengthen them when ready to slip, recover the erring,
and remove all that may hinder them from being really
brought up in Thy faith and love; Who livest and reignest
with the Father and the Holy Ghost ever, one God,
world without end. Amen.</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1. What do you consider the greatest need of the
children of your community?</p>

<p>2. How does this need compare with the needs of
children in the mission land in which you are most interested?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a id="Page_42"></a></span>
3. Name the organizations in your community that
deal with Child Welfare (i.e., milk station, children’s
hospital ward, etc.). How many of these exist in non-Christian
lands? By whom were they introduced?</p>

<p>4. What can a ruling power like the British Government
in India do to bring about better conservation of
motherhood?</p>

<p>5. How would you go to work to eradicate harmful
superstitions in a Mohammedan land?</p>

<p>6. If you were conducting a series of six mothers’
meetings in China, what topics would you select?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Mohammedan
home in
Persia.</div>

<p>The women’s apartments opening onto an
inner court-yard present an animated scene, for
some ladies from another harem have come with
children and servants to make a call; <i>i.e.</i>, to
spend the afternoon, drink unlimited quantities
of tea and pussy-willow-water, smoke unnumbered
cigarettes alternating with the water pipe,
and nibble at sweetmeats and fruits provided in
large abundance. The greetings are conducted
with due decorum by women and children, and
then, while the servants and concubines of the
home move to and fro with the proper refreshments,
and while the children dispose of large
quantities of sweets, the gossip of the neighborhood
is discussed with animation. The conversation,&mdash;no,
it cannot be repeated here, for it is
not fit for the printed page; but little girls sit
eagerly drinking it in, and little boys stop in
their play to wink at each other with knowing
looks as they catch the drift of the talk. A
<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a id="Page_48"></a></span>
mere baby crawls up to attract his mother’s
attention and, not succeeding, slaps her with
all his tiny might as she sits on a cushion on the
floor. “Oh brave boy! oh splendid boy! just
see how he hits me when I do not listen to him!”
And the little boy is hugged and his wishes are
granted while he learns well his lesson of the
inferiority of a woman,&mdash;even his mother. Presently
a little girl begins to scream vigorously,
having been pounded and scratched by a small
boy in the party. The lad is rewarded for his
manliness with a big piece of saffron candy, but
the girl, being a visitor, must be consoled; and
so the delightful promise is made: “Never mind;
stop crying, and we will find you a nice husband.
Now wouldn’t it be fine to arrange a marriage
for her with the son of &mdash;&mdash;?” and so the whole
matter is discussed in the child’s hearing, and
she too learns her lesson,&mdash;that the one ambition
of a girl must be to get married as early as possible,
and the more valuable she is, the greater
settlement must her prospective husband make
upon her, to be paid in case he wishes to divorce
her.</p>

<p>It is evening, the visitors are gone, and the
head of the home with the older boys will take
his evening meal in the anderun (women’s apartment).
No cloth is spread for the whole family.
The husband and sons are served on large copper
trays by the women of the household, who eat
later what is left. The husband is in a wretched
<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a id="Page_49"></a></span>
mood and vents his anger right and left. Even
the favorite wife, a young girl who has recently
superseded in his affections the mothers of his
children, trembles for her position when the rice
is not to his taste; and suddenly at some further
provocation he turns upon her, and with the
words, “I divorce you,” sends her cowering from
him, a divorced woman of fifteen, amid the
sneers and insults of those who served and
fawned on her earlier in the day.</p>

<p class="tb">Scene Two: A hut in Central Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A heathen home
in Africa.</div>

<p>Soon after sunrise a number of women and
girls, laden with hoes, baskets, and babies, start
out from the grass hut which is home to them,
and make their way to the field to work all day
in the hot sun. Having leisurely smoked his
pipe in preparation for the day’s labors, the man
of the house starts with sons and neighbors on
a hunting expedition, or goes to a neighboring
town to exchange his stock for some coveted
article. Towards evening all is bustle and confusion
about the home, as the women have returned
and are preparing the evening meal.
All goes merrily, for here comes the head of the
house in an excellent humor. Picking up the
nearest baby, he fondles it and says, “A man in
the next town has just bought this baby of me
as wife for his son. Being strong and fat and
lusty, she has brought a good price.” Whereupon
a small brother shouts with delight, for
<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a id="Page_50"></a></span>
this means that the dowry for <em>his</em> wife is provided
and the girl on whom he has set his affections
can be procured without further delay. His
mother is pleased,&mdash;the prospect adds to her
importance,&mdash;but the seventeen year old mother
of the fat, cooing baby turns away to hide her
face and surreptitiously to hug her two other
children. “Anyway, they are boys; <em>they</em> cannot
be taken from me.”</p>

<p>The boy who is to profit by the sale of his little
sister is not suited with his evening meal, and,
catching a chicken, he cuts off one leg and demands
that it be cooked for him. No thought
of the suffering fowl interferes with his appetite,
any more than of the little sister so soon to be
sent out on the forest trail, her little brown
body carefully oiled, to be subjected to the blows
and ill-treatment of an unknown mother-in-law.
But even before the little one goes, she
has learned her life lessons,&mdash;that a lie is a crime
only if it is discovered,&mdash;that if she does not like
her husband she may console herself with some
other man so long as she is not found out. And,
after all, the relation may be of short duration,
for, if her future husband is unkind, one of his
wives will surely be an adept in the art of poisoning,
and then all of them will be inherited by his
brother. And so the little brown baby, fondled,
petted, spoiled today, is sent out tomorrow with
foul words on her tongue and foul thoughts in
her heart, to be a wife and the future mother of
<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a id="Page_51"></a></span>
little brown babies whose possibilities are infinite,
whose opportunities are to be,&mdash;what?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Christian
home in Zululand.</div>

<p>“I have already given you a peep at the life
in a heathen kraal. Now repair to a Christian
home. Here we find everything simpler and
more quiet. Here polygamy, with all its attendant
sensualities and riot, has given place to
restraint of passions and a purer union. Here
is but one house and one wife. The Christian
man’s love is now undivided, and all his efforts
are centred in one objective. The single house
is no longer a stack of grass enclosing a dungeon
of darkness, but a square-walled building, humble
indeed, but airy and bright. In place of being
obliged to crawl like animals on our knees into
the heathen hut, we may enter erect as becomes
the dignity of man, through swinging doors.
We come not into a smoky darkness, but into
a dwelling flooded with the light of glazed windows.
In the kraal we found the whole family,
old and young, male and female, huddled together
night and day in the one small room;
here we have a dwelling with separate rooms, so
that parents and children and strangers may
each enjoy some privacy. The air is not only
light with sunshine; it is also pure and clean,
for no cooking operations are performed herein,
<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a id="Page_52"></a></span>
but in a special kitchen outside. In the heathen
hut, whether for sitting or sleeping, we were
accommodated on the floor; now we may sit
more respectably on chairs, eat our meals from
a table, and rest our weary bones on a raised
bed.</p>

<p>“At four or five o’clock in the morning, according
to season,&mdash;for the Zulu is an early riser,&mdash;all
are up. We hear a gentle murmur from within.
Ah! it is the familiar sound, so sweet to us, but
never heard in the heathen kraal. It is the hour
of morning prayer, when husband and wife and
little ones join their hearts and voices together
in a fervent hymn of praise or hopeful supplication
for protection and aid.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The home,

nation’s life.</div>

<p>The home is the centre of a nation’s life.
More and more emphasis is being laid in enlightened
communities on the need of proper
home environment and on the grave risks and
great dangers that accompany the lack of such
environment. If one studies the labors and
writings of the great social and religious workers
of today, this note of emphasis on home life and
training will be heard to ring out loud and clear,
above all other sounds of harmony or discord,&mdash;a
call to meet a definite need.</p>

<p><abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Devine has voiced this thought and enlarged
upon it in its various phases in his recent
book, “The Family and Social Work,” in which
he claims that “To maintain normal family life,

to it, is thus the underlying object of all our

improve general conditions are shaped by our
conception of what constitutes normal family
life.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity’s
gift to non-Christian
homes.</div>

<p>Any candid woman who has studied the “home-scenes”
at the beginning of this chapter and has
then proceeded (as it is hoped and expected that
she will) to study home conditions and surroundings
in other lands, will surely be ready to admit
that the greatest gift Christianity has to offer
to a non-Christian land is the introduction of
the power of the Christ life into the homes of
that land. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Dennis lays great emphasis on
the necessity and opportunity for missionary
endeavor along this line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reconstruction of the family, next to the regeneration
of individual character, is the most precious contribution
of missions to heathen society, and we may add
that it is one of the most helpful human influences which
can be consecrated to the service of social elevation. In
the effort to hallow and purify family life we stir the secret
yearning of fatherhood and motherhood; we enter the
precincts of the home, and take childhood by the hand;
we restore to its place of power and winsomeness in the
domestic circle the ministry of womanhood; and at the
same time we strike at some of the most despicable evils
and desolating wrongs of our fallen world. Nothing in
the history of human society, except the teaching and
example of Jesus Christ, has wrought with such energy
and wisdom in introducing saving power into social
development as a sanctified home life. If parental
<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a id="Page_54"></a></span>
training can be made loving, faithful, conscientious, and
helpful, if womanhood can be redeemed and crowned, if
childhood can be guided in tenderness and wisdom, if the
home can be made a place where virtue dwells, and moral
goodness is nourished and becomes strong and brave for
the conflicts of life, we can conceive of no more effective
combination of invigorating influences for the rehabilitation
of fallen society than will therein be given.<a id="Anchor-16" title="Go to Footnote 16" href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Greatness of
the task.</div>

<p>The task fairly staggers us with its greatness
and its limitless scope; but let us be big enough
to look even beyond all this, and, with the glorious
capacity for motherhood that lies in every good
woman’s breast, let us see not only the millions
of homes that are in darkness and sorrow and
degradation today, but also realize that the
children of today are to be the fathers and mothers
of tomorrow. Our work as a “great, beautiful,
organized motherhood for the world” must include
the preparation of these children to assume
the duties of parenthood in the future, and
to raise from generation to generation the standards
of individual and home and national life
“till we all attain unto a full grown man, unto
the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disorderly
homes.</div>

<p>The physical conditions of a home, and the
moral and spiritual characters developed in the
home act and re-act on each other with clock-like
precision. Would you expect a neat and
orderly housemaid if you engaged a girl from a
<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a id="Page_55"></a></span>
home in China which Mrs. S. C. Perkins thus
<span class="nowrap">describes?&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The great mass of the people live in what can only be
called hovels, the family occupying one room, shared
with pigs and chickens; damp, dark, unventilated, and
unclean. Even in the houses of the rich there is a certain
cheerlessness owing to the lack of carpets, the absence
of sunlight, and the stiff arrangement of the furniture.
The odor of incense in all houses renders the atmosphere
close and unpleasant. The people will not use whitewash,
because white is an unlucky color; indeed, their
many superstitions interfere with the comfort of the
poorer classes quite as much as does their poverty. In
Northern China every house has its kang, a platform
of stone about two feet high, underneath which a fire is
kindled for warmth and for cooking, the heat being
carried through it by a flue into the chimney. Here the
family sleep at night, sit by day, and on it they cook
their food.<a id="Anchor-17" title="Go to Footnote 17" href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much ambition would one be able to arouse
in a school girl coming from this home in Burma?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The home of one of the mission school girls is described
in this way: “It is a large teakwood house, and we walk
right in, for there is no door bell. The large hall is half
filled with piles of wood, for the family lives on the second
floor. A servant tells us to go up, and we climb the long
stairs. At the top we find the lady of the house sitting on
a mat smoking. She motions us to be seated. In the
large room are two mats, two chairs, and two tables.”<a id="Anchor-18" title="Go to Footnote 18" href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Absence of
innocence.</div>

<p>Innocent childhood, modesty, purity can
hardly be counted on in the unnumbered homes
of Africa, India, Persia, Korea, and other lands
<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a id="Page_56"></a></span>
where the whole family lives in one room, where
sons bring their brides to swell the number of
those whose every act and word is seen or heard
by the whole patriarchal family. If further
evidence is needed of the inter-relation of the
physical home surroundings and the formation
of character, study the history of those savage
communities that have come under the power
of the Gospel, as for instance the New Hebrides
Islands, and it will be very evident that “godliness
is profitable for all things,” even for introducing
a comfortable, tidy home in which one
can stand upright and enjoy some degree of
privacy!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral influences.</div>

<p>In order to learn what should be done for
little children in non-Christian lands, we must
know in addition to their physical needs something
of the moral and spiritual influences that
surround them. Of the spiritual influences we
shall speak in a later chapter, and, though the
moral effects on life and character have already
been touched on in various ways, it seems wise
to sum up briefly some of the special home
influences that affect child life in the lands of
which we are studying. We must be humble
and teachable too, for it is true that we Americans
could well be learners when it comes to the
lessons in filial piety taught to Chinese children,
and the careful attention to etiquette and social
graces which form an important part of the
training of Japanese girls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chinese
Mother Ideal.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="57"><a id="Page_57"></a></span>
In a most interesting and enlightening study
of “The Chinese Mother Ideal”<a id="Anchor-19" title="Go to Footnote 19" href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Mrs. Gammon
shows that “even a cursory glance through
Chinese literature reveals teachings which if
carried into effect might transform the whole
empire.” But alas! “to the majority of the
women of China the printed page is a sealed
book,” and in many of the moral as well as the
spiritual teachings we find minute instructions
for outward observances, but no life-principles
upon which true character may be built.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil influences
surrounding
the children.</div>

<p>Immodesty, shocking impurity, dishonesty,
lying, disobedience, foul and abusive language,
quarrelsomeness, bad habits, cruelty, anger,
jealousy,&mdash;we might go on with the long terrible
list of influences that surround the child from
babyhood up, that are a part of his heritage, and
are not treated as evils to be uprooted by careful
training and wholesome example, but as
qualities to be emulated. One of the “Sacred
Books” of Burma says, “A statement constitutes
a lie when discovered by the person to
whom it is told to be untrue!” In the same way
millions of children are today being taught that
sin is sin only when it is found out or when it
inconveniences a superior avenging power. How
to teach the mothers so that their example and
precepts may produce different children, that
is our great problem. We hear of a convert in
India who told a missionary that she “often
<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a id="Page_58"></a></span>
prays for power to forget the words she heard
and the things she saw and the games she played
when she was a little child in her mother’s room.”
I often recall an impromptu mothers’ meeting
held on the mud roof of a village home in Persia,
where the text was furnished by a self-righteous
mother whose child had misbehaved at the
afternoon service conducted by my husband.
The mother boasted that she had dragged her
child out of the meeting and beaten him on the
head till his nose bled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lack of proper
discipline.</div>

<p>Of real discipline,&mdash;punishment administered
in love, not in anger, for the purpose of teaching
great life principles, I have yet to discover a
trace in homes untouched by the love of Christ
in the lands of which we are speaking. Love
there is, and how often the unexpressed yearning
of the mother heart finds utterance at last when
she comes into contact with a mother who <em>knows</em>
of these things.

<span class="sidenote">“No plan.”</span>

A young missionary mother
from China told me about a pleasant gathering of
women in her parlor after her youngest baby was
born. One woman said to her, “I wish I knew
what to do when my children are naughty. I
have no plan.” The poor woman was nursing
her fourth baby, and worn by wakeful nights and
constant nursing was in no condition, physically,
mentally, or morally, to rule wisely her mischievous,
disobedient, crying children.</p>

<p>From the vast amount of interesting information
which our missionaries are glad to share
<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a id="Page_59"></a></span>
with us the moment this subject is broached, it
is difficult to select something for the limited
space in this chapter. In this as in other instances,
the intention is rather to whet the
appetite for more, than to make an exhaustive
study of the subject. Miss G. Y. Holliday of
Persia says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find children passionately longed for, much loved,
though not at all wisely; often the tyrants of the household.
It is a sad commentary on the depravity of human
nature, that no matter what outrage a child commits or
how abominable his conduct may be, it is considered an
all-sufficient excuse to say, “He is a child,” as if there were
no such things as good and well behaved children, and
nothing else was to be expected but disorder and disobedience
from them. The atmosphere of a Moslem
home is so bad for them, with the continual swearing and
vile language. I was talking one day to a small boy,
the idol of his grandparents, with whom he spends most
of his time. The subject was family discipline; I said,
“Parents sometimes find it necessary to punish the children.”
He replied with emphasis, his eyes opening wider
and wider, “Yes, parents whip, they kick, they strike.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lack of innocence
coupled
with appalling
ignorance.</div>

<p>One of the most terrible results to children of
the lack of proper home life and training is loss
of innocence coupled with appalling ignorance.
This condition existing also in our own land is
being faced in these days with new purpose and
determination by earnest, conscientious men and
women who are seeking in many ways to find
and apply a remedy. From the many strong,
true writers and speakers on this subject we
select a few words written by Professor E. P.
<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a id="Page_60"></a></span>
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of the Hartford School of Religious
Pedagogy.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Prof. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
on sex knowledge.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>It is unsafe to leave a child ignorant about sex. The
writer firmly believes that a majority of the evils that
appear in connection with this phase of human nature
could be avoided by simple, frank instruction of children
and youth. The great trouble has been that parents
who have clean ideas about sex and its relations have
kept their lips sealed on the subject.... Even if it were
desirable, children <em>cannot</em> be kept in ignorance of these
things. <em>Through the parents’ neglect</em> their thoughts of
these matters have too often been perverted and impure
from the first. The aim should be to pre-empt the ground
for cleanness and truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">A missionary
mother’s
“dream.”</div>

<p>All honor and assistance be given to the
missionary mother who, feeling the horrible need
of China’s children and youth in this respect, is
spending much of her furlough year in working
out a plan,&mdash;a “dream” she calls it. Will you
listen to her dream, and then see if it is not in
your power to help the missionary mothers
whom <em>you</em> know to make this dream a great and
living reality in many of the dark habitations of
the earth? “A Chinese child knows all there is
to be known about the deep life truths, and knows
it without the beauty of life being impressed
on him. I am going to tell you a dream I have.
Perhaps it is not necessary to speak of it, but
it will show how strongly the awfulness of conditions
has forced certain truths on me. I am
inquiring among my friends, those who would
know, what are the best books of sex knowledge
<span class="pagenum" title="61"><a id="Page_61"></a></span>
for men and women, and especially the books or
stories for children. I am already beginning
the little nature stories with my own boys and
intend to teach them scientifically all the truths
about themselves so beautifully and so naturally
and so early that they will never know when
they weren’t acquainted with these facts, and
will never have aught but the deepest love for
the knowledge I give them. I think I can do
it, with plenty of study and determination.
Then as I know Chinese better, I want to conduct
classes for mothers and for children, and also to
get hold of our school boys and talk to them or
put literature in their hands that will make better
men of them. If I stayed in this country, I
should push such knowledge at every turn. I
expect to keep a library that I can loan to American
sailors and other young men. I thoroughly
believe that the propagation of such information
will do more to change the life of children and
the atmosphere of the Chinese home than anything
else. For with this knowledge one learns
the beauty and wonder of a God that could
make such a beautiful human body. It is wonderful
to see what Christian homes <em>are</em> doing,
but how much more they could do with <em>knowledge</em>,
scientific Christian knowledge, in the hearts of
the parents!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of the
father.</div>

<p>The position of the husband and father in
most non-Christian lands is that of supreme
ruler and despot in his home. In many cases
<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a id="Page_62"></a></span>
he has the power of life and death over his children,
during infancy at least, and where polygamy
exists many a wife has suddenly disappeared,
never to be heard of again; but no one thinks
of questioning the rights of the husband in the
matter. His attitude toward the mothers of
his children is the “sample copy” for his boys
to imitate, and right faithfully do they follow
his example.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">An Egyptian
father.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>In the native quarter of Alexandria, Egypt, I saw a
little boy who was very fond of making mud-pies in front
of the house. One afternoon his mother stepped into
the doorway and called:</p>

<p>“Come in, darling; don’t get your clothes so dirty.
Come in, sweet one.” No answer from the four-year-old.</p>

<p>The mother stepped into the road, looking about to
see that there were no men near to watch her, and laid a
kind motherly hand on the child to take him into the
house.</p>

<p>“Come, little one. I will give you sweets; come!”</p>

<p>Her husband at that moment came around the next
corner, and stood still to see what would happen. The
child turned on his mother, and, doubling up his little
dirty fist, he beat her right in the face, and snarled,
“Bint el kelb!” (Daughter of a dog), tearing himself
loose.</p>

<p>The father stepped up, and, in place of giving the little
scoundrel a thrashing, he patted his son on the back,
smiled upon him, and said: “Brave little fellow! Thou
magnificent little fellow!” Proud of the son who could
treat a woman thus!<a id="Anchor-20" title="Go to Footnote 20" href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

Oh! it is a sight to make angels rejoice when

needs and sufferings of those dependent on him!
In a Persian village where a missionary lady was
touring, a man came to evening prayers and
slipped a note into her hand that read, “Receive
M. B. with love,&mdash;he is a brother.” Several
years later she again visited the village, but
though she had no opportunity to talk with
M. B. she saw something that spoke louder and
more forcibly than a dozen conversations would
have done. When he was ready to go home
from the meeting in the missionary’s rooms, he
said to his wife, “Give me the child,” and took
the heavy, sleeping boy out of her arms. In
all her long years of work among Mohammedans
this missionary had never seen a Mohammedan
man do such a thing.</p>

</div>

<p>“A Japanese woman whose husband is a
Christian,” writes Miss Ransome, “though she
is as yet only an inquirer, said recently that
the change for the better had been so marvelous
in her husband that she had decided to try to
rear her boy in such a way that he would eventually
become an evangelist. She wanted others
to know of the power of Christianity which could
<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a id="Page_64"></a></span>
change a quarrelsome, drinking man to a kind,
sober, industrious father.” That boy’s chance
for a happy, useful life was the direct result of
what the knowledge of Christ had done for his
father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motherhood.</div>

<p>The sacred vocation of motherhood is regarded
almost entirely from a commercial or social
standpoint in non-Christian lands. The free
woman who remains unmarried is wellnigh an
impossibility,&mdash;she has no chance for winning
respect or position in this life, and, according to
Mohammedan belief, has a very inferior place in
heaven. The woman who marries and has no
children needs one’s sympathy almost as much
as does her unmarried sister. In many cases
she may be divorced after a certain number of
years if no child has been born to her, or she
lives in dread of having another wife brought
into the home, who will make her life miserable
with taunts such as Peninnah heaped upon
Hannah in days of old. And there is no hope that
her lord and master will comfort her as Elkanah
comforted Hannah, offering her the devotion of
ten sons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A mother of girls.</div>

<p>But the unmarried woman and the childless
wife are not alone in their degradation and
distress. Never can I forget my feelings when
told of a neighbor in Persia who had just given
birth to her seventh daughter. Her husband on
visiting the room crossed over to where she
lay on her bed on the floor, looked at her with
<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a id="Page_65"></a></span>
disgust and disapproval, spat in her face and
covered it with a cloth to show that she was a
disgraced wife. To be the mother of sons is the
great wish of a woman’s heart, to have many
daughters-in-law brought into the home to serve
her and cower before her tyranny is her fondest
ambition, and when she attains it her influence
is indeed great, and in one respect at least she
is queen of her home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundations of
family life.</div>

<p>Is it a mistake in this study of child life to
pay so much attention to the subjects of fatherhood
and motherhood? Nowhere can we find
the real remedy for the evils that degrade and
debase and oppress and crush the sweet innocence
and dependence of childhood unless we
go back of the child to the very foundations of
family life. Many great authorities in America
and Europe, as well as those who have labored
and studied in Oriental lands, will testify to the
truth of this statement. <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. Sadler of
Amoy says, “You would be profoundly impressed
if you could realize how the strength of heathenism
is in the women. From earliest years they
teach their children concerning demons, and to
be early eager as to inheritance, and thus inspire
selfish and quarrelsome ideas leading to divisions
and life-long conflicts. The importance of women’s
work cannot be estimated. The destiny of
the country is largely in their hands.”<a id="Anchor-21" title="Go to Footnote 21" href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Training
Christian
wives and
mothers.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="66"><a id="Page_66"></a></span>
This is one side of the picture. The other is
equally true. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Daniel McGilvary, for half a
century a missionary among the Siamese and
Lao, tells of the wonderful result of a school for
girls that provides Christian wives and mothers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding our disappointment in the delay of
the school for boys, it proved a wise arrangement that
the girls’ school was started first. A mission church is
sure to be greatly handicapped whose young men must
either remain single,&mdash;which they will not do,&mdash;or be
compelled to take ignorant non-Christian wives....
After marriage the almost universal custom of the country
has been that the husband lives with the wife’s family....
Where all the atmosphere of the family is strongly
Buddhist, with daily offerings to the spirits and gala days
at the temple, the current would be too strong for a
father, with his secondary place in the family, to withstand.
For a while it was feared that Christian girls
would have difficulty in finding husbands. But, on the
contrary, our educated girls become not only more intelligent,
but more attractive in manners, dress, and character;
and therefore, have been much sought after. The
homes become Christian homes, and the children are
reared in a Christian atmosphere. The result is that, instead
of the wife’s dragging the husband down, she generally
raises the husband up; and, as a general rule, the
children early become Christians.<a id="Anchor-22" title="Go to Footnote 22" href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mohammedan girl educated in a Christian
school, even though she must marry and live
her life according to Mohammedan customs,
takes with her to her father-in-law’s home new
ideas and customs that are going far to break
<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a id="Page_67"></a></span>
down the old walls of prejudice. Mrs. C. M.
Wherry of India <span class="nowrap">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most interesting facts that has come to
light during recent years is this: We do not know of any
educated Moslem girl who has spent four or five years
in our schools,&mdash;and I include those of the British workers
too,&mdash;who has ever been subjected to the indignity
of a second wife brought into her home. They seem to
have gained strength of character and graces enough to
hold their own against the bad influences of Mohammedanism.
More and more we hear of Moslem families
who practically adopt the Christian idea of marriage,
that is, one woman in the home: these families frequently
in giving away their daughters take pledges from the
bridegroom that she is to be the only wife, while still
more encouraging is the fact that many of these educated
girls absolutely refuse to be given in marriage unless their
parents insist on this single wife.<a id="Anchor-23" title="Go to Footnote 23" href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little Mohammedan girl had attended for
a few months a small day school on the mission
premises. Years afterwards her missionary
teacher found her in a village, and the woman
gathering her children about her led them in the
Lord’s Prayer, explaining that she and the
children prayed together every day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Christian

Syria.</div>

<p>Who can foretell the influence that will go
on down through the years because of one mother
in Syria who has recently passed to her reward
at the age of ninety years? She was the mother
of eight children, two of whom were ordained

<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a id="Page_68"></a></span>

Missionary Society in Nazareth, and two more
are teaching and preaching in the German

Him, and to train her children as a Christian
mother should.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Child

<p>Many chapters might easily be devoted to
the subjects of child marriage and child widowhood
and their frightful effect on past, present,
and future generations. They have, however,
been treated quite fully in recent mission study
books, and so much authoritative literature on
these subjects exists that it does not seem best to
dwell on them at length in this connection.</p>

<p>But every Christian mother should pause and
ask of herself earnestly, “What if it were my
daughter, my son, how could I stand it? Would
I not move heaven and earth to see that some
remedy were found for this monstrous evil?”
What if your daughter were that widowed
teacher in a missionary school in China who
had been married at nineteen to a boy of twelve,
and who every morning after washing his face
and combing his hair had to see that he started
off properly to school, often crying and protesting,
and then turn to her weaving, in order to earn
money for his education?</p>

its warmth, but you suffer much from its smoke. How
many of us have suffered from this cause? The excuse
given for it is that it is to preserve our youth from impurity.
But what a feeble excuse! Silence were better
than such.<a id="Anchor-24" title="Go to Footnote 24" href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The betrothed
boy in Korea.</div>

<p>Strange customs prevail in different lands regarding
betrothal and marriage. Their effect
upon the life and status of the boy seems to be
peculiarly marked in Korea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The matter of becoming a full-fledged man does not
depend upon years, but is a matter to be decided on its
merits by the parents or guardians of the subject in hand.
The badge of manhood is none other than the topknot,
which is made by combing all the hair to the top of the
head and making it into a coil about an inch and a half in
diameter and four or five inches high. From the time
the boy’s hair is long enough, it is plaited into a straight
braid and left hanging down his back. When the time
comes for him to be engaged to marry, his topknot is
put up, and from that time forth he is recognized as a
man. This usually takes place between the ages of ten
and twenty, though he is not likely to be so old as twenty....</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="70"><a id="Page_70"></a></span>
As long as a boy wears his hair plaited and hanging down
his back, he is addressed in low talk. His age has nothing
to do with the form of speech, but the style of his hair
settles that. It sometimes happens that a very poor
family will not be able to contract a marriage for their
son, and so we occasionally meet a man thirty years old
with his hair still hanging down his back.... But the
boy who is honored with the precious topknot is addressed
in middle or high talk, though he may be only eight or
ten years old.<a id="Anchor-25" title="Go to Footnote 25" href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Customs preceding
marriage.</div>

<p>A girl’s hair receives special attention among
the Persian Mohammedans, and must be banged
when she is taken to the public bath on the day
preceding her marriage. In one of the islands of
the New Hebrides the struggling girl is held down
by several old women while her two upper front
teeth are knocked out as a necessary preparation
for marriage.</p>

<p>Among the Lao, where marriage is much more
honored and considered more sacred than in many
other countries, the boys are freer to do their
courting in person, and both boys and girls
have far more voice in the selection of a life
partner than in countries where women live in
seclusion and where polygamy abounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The burden
of motherhood.</div>

<p>Through long years there has run in my ears
the brief story of a Christian servant in one of
the missionary homes in Persia. “I was married
at twelve years and had a baby when I was
thirteen, and, oh! how glad I was when it died!”
<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a id="Page_71"></a></span>
Glad? Of course she was glad. What child of
thirteen would want the burden of motherhood?</p>

<p>Who of us who has witnessed the agonies of
the little dying child-mother can ever for a
moment think with carelessness or indifference
of the awful custom of child marriage?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A dying child-wife.</div>

<p>“A girl of fifteen was dying,” writes a friend
from India. “Her husband, a man of fifty or
more, is a man of good position and considerable
means. The girl lay in a bare room with nothing
but an unbaked earthenware vessel near
her. Her <em>second</em> baby had been born a few days
or weeks before and something was wrong.... But
she was a purdah woman and could not see the
doctor. He had asked a few questions from
outside and had diagnosed the illness as tuberculosis,
was treating it as such,&mdash;and had given it
as his opinion that she would die. Our pastor’s
wife, dear Mrs. Roy, had somehow gone to see
her. Even her non-professional eye saw that a
mistake had been made, and she tried to persuade
the mother to send for a woman doctor. ‘What
was the use? She was doing to die.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Roy expostulated indignantly with the
mother for having married this child of twelve
to a grown-up man, just for money. The poor
child seemed so sad. Mrs. Roy told her of the
Christian’s hope and a Saviour’s love. The child
listened with the tears running down her face.
Then she asked, ‘May I touch you?’ (Being
a mother of a few days she was still unclean and
<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a id="Page_72"></a></span>
no one would touch her). So Mrs. Roy went
to her and held her hands and stroked her face
and hair and tried to give her comfort for the
journey for which she was so little prepared.
Thus is the ‘hope of India’ MURDERED by
custom and carelessness and greed. <em>Oh, India is
horrible!</em>”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statistics
from India.
Child-marriage;
Child-widowhood.</div>

<p>From the <cite>Missionary Review of the World</cite>
(August, 1911) we quote the following statistics,
each word and figure of which cries out to us
Christian women, “How long, oh, how long,
shall these things be?”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The figures are appalling in respect of child-marriages.
The census of 1901 showed 121,500 married boys and
243,500 married girls, whose age was under five: 760,000
boys and 2,030,000 girls between the ages of five and ten;
2,540,000 and 6,586,000 between ten and fifteen. Of these,
all except a certain number of girls under the last class
were married before they were able to realize what marriage
is. The most deplorable result of such marriages
is seen in the number of widowed children; 6,000 widowers
and 96,000 widows were between five and ten; 113,000
widowers and 276,000 widows between ten and fifteen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The homes of
the world need
Christ.</div>

<p>The homes of the world need nothing so
much as the presence and blessing of the Christ
who brought cheer to the home in Cana, comfort
to the widow’s home at Nain, resurrection and
life to the home at Bethany, vision to the home
in Emmaus. How are <em>we</em> to help to make it possible
that fathers, mothers, and children in homes
where He is not known should hear Him as He
stands at the door and knocks, and shall open

to Him that He may sup with them and they with
Him?

<span class="sidenote">Three methods
of bringing
Christ to needy
homes.</span>

There are at least three practical methods
by which Christian women may help to bring
about this result.</p>

<p><i>First</i>: Through Christian schools which take
children and youth in their impressionable years
and train them to be the Christian fathers and
mothers of the future. We have briefly alluded
to this method and shall speak of it more at
length in a later chapter.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>: In Zenana work and other forms of
visiting in the homes, in crowded cities, and
isolated villages, taking to each individual home
the story of the Christ who gathered the little
ones in His arms, and the practical, homely
lessons of efforts that Christian civilization is
making in behalf of home life.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>: Through the great object lesson, the
missionary home.</p>

<p>Never again let it be asked in church or missionary
society of a young woman starting for
the foreign field, “Are you going out as a missionary,
or only as a missionary’s wife?” At a
conference for outgoing missionaries, a beautiful,
talented college graduate, leader in many activities
and full of capacity and consecration, said
to a returned missionary,&mdash;“I am to be married,
and have listened and listened at this conference
to know what particular work is waiting for me,
but there has been <em>nothing</em> for me as yet.” When
it was pointed out to her that by means of her
<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a id="Page_74"></a></span>
paramount duties and obligations as wife and
mother in a missionary home she would have an
opportunity of <em>living</em> the missionary message
such as few of her fellow missionaries might
have, her beautiful face lighted up with a look
that illumined it. The making of a missionary
home was a vocation indeed to call forth all the
highest powers of her consecrated womanhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">E. A. Lawrence
on missionary
homes.</div>

<p>Mr. E. A. Lawrence has stated so clearly the
possibilities and opportunities of the missionary
home that he is worth quoting at length.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is an element of missionary life which is seldom
presented, yet most important. It is the mission home....
It underlies the whole of the work, and discloses
the ideal of Protestant missions more clearly than any
other point....</p>

<p>The first thing the Protestant missionary does among
the heathen is to establish a home. He approaches them
not as a priest, not simply as a man, but as the head of a
family, presenting Christianity quite as much in its social
as in its individual characteristics. This Christian home
is to be the transforming centre of a new community.
Into the midst of pagan masses, where society is coagulated
rather than organized, where homes are degraded
by parental tyranny, marital multiplicity, and female
bondage, he brings the leaven of a redeemed family,
which is to be the nucleus of a redeemed society.... It
is on this mission home that everything else is founded&mdash;the
school, the college, the kingdom itself....</p>

<p>When they are at their homes, this new institution,
with its monogamy, its equality of man and woman, its
sympathy between child and parent, its co-operative
spirit of industry, its intelligence, its recreation, its
worship, is at once a new revelation and a striking object-lesson
<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a id="Page_75"></a></span>
of the meaning and possibility of family life.
Whether they come to his church and school or not, the
natives seem always ready to visit the missionary’s home,
and to remain there so long, and to conduct themselves so
familiarly, that it sometimes becomes necessary to teach
them by object-lesson another feature of the Christian
home&mdash;its privacy....</p>

<p>If the family in its very existence is an important
missionary agent, having a distinct work to do, not only
for its own members, but for the natives, ... then there
must be a distinct acceptance of this office by its members,
and it must play its part in the outreaching work of the
missionary. The natives must be brought in contact
with this domestic sphere. The walls of the home should
be at least translucent, that its light may continually
shine through to them; its doors should be often open,
its table often spread for them; a distinct social as well
as Christian fellowship should be cultivated.<a id="Anchor-26" title="Go to Footnote 26" href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">At the missionary’s
table.</div>

<p>“Given to Hospitality” might be the true
epitaph on the headstone of most missionary
wives, and untold lessons in love and deference
between husband and wife, obedience of children,
interesting and profitable table conversation,
self-control, and courtesy, are taught in
the missionary dining room as they could never
be taught in church or school room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Planning the
day’s work.</div>

<p>“Won’t you write an article on the orderly
management of a home for the paper published
by the mission?” begged a young Christian
teacher who was spending her vacation week as
a guest in the missionary home. “The work of
<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a id="Page_76"></a></span>
each servant and person in this house is arranged
for every day, and everything goes on quietly
and regularly. Our women have no plan for
their day’s work, and I wish they might know
how you do it.”</p>

<p>“I was taking dinner at the home of Mr. C.,”
said a native pastor, “and his little boy cried
for some more of the food he liked. Instead of
giving it to him, his mother actually sent him
away from the table to stay until he could be
pleasant! I never heard of such a thing, but I
went home and told my family about it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Learning to
cook.</div>

<p>Mrs. J. C. Worley of Matsuyama, Japan,
writes: “One woman whom Mr. Worley baptized
a year ago walked thirty-five miles over
the mountains and carried a baby on her back
to get to us so she could learn foreign cooking in
a week. I could not do too much after she had
made such an effort. She came over every morning
into our kitchen, and we proceeded to cook;
she with paper and pencil in hand and watching
with both eyes. I am wondering what I shall
be expected to eat next time we go there. I
taught her some new songs for the Sunday
School she and her husband hold in their little
mountain village. I just wanted to fill her up
with good thoughts and helps to take home, as
she had made such an effort to get here.”<a id="Anchor-27" title="Go to Footnote 27" href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The baby who

<p>Even the little missionary children may have
their unconscious share in kindling a new light
<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a id="Page_77"></a></span>
that shall shine in palace and hovel, and be reflected
in the faces of parents and children who
have long since lost the radiant look they were
meant to wear. A woman of high position was
making a very formal call in the missionary
home, accompanied by many retainers. Every
effort was made by the ladies of the station to
entertain her fittingly and to bring some gleam
of interest to the weary, hopeless face. The
piano, beautiful pictures, the wonderful writing
machine (typewriter), dainty refreshments,&mdash;all
were acknowledged courteously, but, neither
interest nor heart was touched. At last in desperation
the tiny baby in her dainty, long dress
was brought out from the bedroom, and, as the
visitor’s arms were stretched out eagerly for the
cunning form, so different from any baby she
had ever seen, the little face looked up into the
sad, wondering eyes, and a beautiful smile crept
into the baby eyes and hovered about the rosebud
mouth. “Oh, see,” whispered the servants
in eager watchfulness, “our lady is smiling,&mdash;smiling
for the first time since her brother died.
God bless the little baby who made her smile!”</p>

<p>Ah yes! God bless the missionary babies, and
the missionary fathers and mothers, and every
one of the men and women whose hearts glow
with the love of the great Father whose supreme
will it is that “not one of these little ones should
perish!”</p>

<h3>QUOTATIONS&mdash;CHAPTER <abbr title="two">II</abbr>.</h3>

<h4>CHRISTIANITY AND THE HOME</h4>

<p>Christianity will call into existence a sympathy between
parents and children hitherto unknown, and one of the
greatest needs of the Chinese home. It will teach parents
to <em>govern</em> their children, an accomplishment which
in four millenniums they have never made an approach to
acquiring. This it will do, not as at present by the mere
iterative insistence upon the duty of subjection to parents,
but by showing parents how first to govern themselves,
teaching them the completion of the first relations
by the addition of that chiefest one hitherto unknown,
expressed in the words Our Father. It will redeem
many years during the first decade of childhood, of what
is now a mere animal existence, filling it with fruitfulness
for a future intellectual and spiritual harvest.</p>

<p>It will show Chinese parents how to <em>train</em> as well as
how to govern their children&mdash;a divine art of which they
have at present no more conception than of the chemistry
of soils. (<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Arthur H. Smith, “Village Life in
China.” Revell.)</p>

<h4>MOTHERS’ MEETINGS</h4>

<p>I have been much interested in our Mothers’ Meetings
this winter. They meet at our house twice a month, and
we have been trying to have some very practical talks
which shall help them to be better mothers and women.
The need for such talks is very great, and I wonder more
and more that so many children escape physical and moral
wreck. Our more intelligent women realize their need
for instruction and help, and are very grateful for the
opportunities given them by these meetings, but a large
number come only out of curiosity. Some of the young
women say, “You ought to have these meetings for our
mothers-in-law instead of for us. They govern the house
<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a id="Page_79"></a></span>
and our children. We would like to try these methods.
We know they are right, but we are not allowed our way.”
But I know it is hopeless to do anything with the grandmothers,
and I believe that at least these young women
will learn enough to keep their hands off when their
turn comes to be mothers-in-law! It’s a long look ahead,
but well worth while to plan for the future generation,
even though we cannot do all we long to for the present
one. (Mrs. Henry Riggs, Harpoot, Turkey.)</p>

<h4>A TRANSFORMED HOME</h4>

<p>In a small village near Hoi-How lived Sitli Nin, a poor
woman, worn out by a life of hard work, bitter poverty,
and sorrow. Her husband had become a victim of the
opium habit, and squandered what little property she
had. When her eldest boy was eight years old, the
inhuman father, in order to gratify his cravings, sold
him to a Hong Kong boatman, and the mother never
heard from him since. Eight times she had attempted
suicide, three times by drowning, three times by hanging,
and twice by taking opium; but in the latter case she
had failed to take enough, and the other times love for
her children restrained her at the last moment. By some
chance the ladies of our mission found her. Her husband
was persuaded to take the opium cure at the hospital....
While he was in the hospital, she attended the services
at the mission, and was genuinely converted. Her
husband was cured, and they went home rejoicing in
their new-found happiness. (Josephine P. Osmond,
“Home Life in Hainan,” leaflet of Women’s Foreign
Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church)</p>

<h4>CHILD MARRIAGE, INDIA</h4>

<p>Sir W. W. Hunter says, “In Bengal, out of every
thousand girls between five and nine years of age, two
<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a id="Page_80"></a></span>
hundred and seventy-one are married. More than ten
boys in every thousand between five and ten years old
are bridegrooms; while of girls, twenty-eight in one hundred
are wives or widows at an age when, if they were
in Europe, they would be in the nursery or infant school.”</p>

<p>In England, out of every hundred females of twenty
years of age and upwards, 25.80 are single, 60.60 are
married and 13.60 widows.</p>

<p>“A Brahmin of Bengal gave away his six aunts, eight
sisters, and four daughters in a batch of altogether eighteen,
in marriage to one person&mdash;a boy less than ten years
old. The brides of three generations were in age from
about fifty years to three months at the lowest. The
baby bride was brought to the ceremony on a brass
plate.” (Quoted from <cite>Times</cite> of India.)</p>

<p>The origin and authority for early marriage are worthy
of inquiry. Like so many Hindu customs, it claims a
quasi-divine authority, and is based on certain reasons
which, from the Hindu point of view, are of great weight.
“Reprehensible,” says Manu, “is the father who gives
not his daughter in marriage at the proper time.” And
all commentators say the proper time is before the age
of puberty.... A high legal authority, Mr. Justice
Moothoswami <a id="tn_1">Iyer</a>, recently said, “According to custom
now obtaining, a Brahmin girl is bound to marry, for
fear of social degradation, before she attains maturity.
Marriage is of the nature of a sacrament which no Brahmin
is at liberty to neglect without forfeiting his caste.”...
Thus a religious or sacramental purpose has been operative
here, as in most other departments of Hindu life
and thought.... There has been one strong incentive
to early marriage, which in the past might be urged in
its justification. The unsettled, precarious conditions of
life, from the remotest times until the establishment of
British power, encouraged parents to have their children
married as soon as possible. (<abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> E. Storrow, “Our
Sisters in India.” Revell.)</p>

<p class="pagenum-h4-p"><span class="pagenum" title="81"><a id="Page_81"></a></span></p>

<h4>CHILD-WIVES, PERSIA</h4>

<p>The usual age for a Mohammedan girl to marry is
thirteen or fourteen, but in many places they marry as
early as eight.... Poor little girl wives! They are
taken away from home before they are grown up, and
although they are now married women they cannot help
behaving as children. There was one young wife of a
Government official who received her visitors with the
utmost dignity and propriety, and then could not resist
the temptation to pinch the old black woman who was
handing the tea and make her jump....</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/bride.jpg" width="472" height="600" alt="" title=""/>
  <p class="caption"><span class="smallcaps">A Little Goanese Bride in India</span></p>
</div>

<p>Even when the children grow older their mothers,
grown-up children themselves, do not know how to
manage them.... One woman bit her little boy’s hand
till it bled badly. He was about seven, and had cried to
have his best coat on when he went to see the missionary.
Another woman bit the cheek of a poor little consumptive
girl of eight or nine so that there was a great bruise and
the skin was broken. She told a neighbor, with a laugh,
that she had got angry with the child because she was
tiresome about taking her medicine, which was very nasty.</p>

<p>There is no command in the Koran that girls should be
married so young, but the mothers declare that it was
the command of Mohammed, and certainly he himself
set the example by marrying a girl of nine....</p>

<p>The man is absolute master in his own house, and
unless his wife has powerful relations he may do what he
likes to her and her children, and no one will take any
notice. I knew one woman whose husband treated her
like a slave. He forced her not only to do all the work
of the house, but the work of the stable too, for he was
well enough off to keep a horse. He killed one child in
her arms, and twice stole another away from her, sending
it once to a town a week’s journey off, and once to another
part of the town. Finally he divorced her, without
giving any reason, and left her ill and destitute. And
she had at no time any redress....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="82"><a id="Page_82"></a></span>
Little Bagum, the child-wife, was deliberately and
cruelly burnt by her husband, and was brought to the
mission hospital. There was no hope of recovery, but
all was done that was possible to relieve her pain and
brighten her last days. She had heard something of the
Gospel story from a missionary who had paid a visit
to her native village, and she had been so interested that
she asked two Persian children to teach her more. When
she was brought to the hospital even the terrible pain she
was suffering did not make her forget the wonderful
story, and she begged to be told more and more. And,
resting in the love of Christ and trusting wholly in Him
and His salvation, she loved to sing of the joy to which
He was going to take her, and kept begging for “Here
we suffer grief and pain,” until even the Mohammedan
women would sit beside her and sing the hymn that
comforted her so much....</p>

<p>“I have a foolish husband,” said one little girl, “He
says he will beat Jesus Christ out of me, but he can only
beat my body, and Jesus Christ is in my heart, so he
cannot beat Him out.”</p>

What is play?</p>

<div class="sidenote">How would
you answer
these questions?</div>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of
play?</p>

<p>At what age would you wish your child to stop
playing?</p>

<p>What would be the physical and moral consequences
to a child who practically stopped playing
at or before the age of ten years?</p>

<p>At what age would you advise that a child
begin to work for commercial profit?</p>

<p>If it is good for the children in whom you are
interested to have time and opportunity for play,
how far would the same rule hold good for other
children in America? For children of other countries?</p>

<p>Name the countries in which defective and
dependent children may be neglected or overworked
without danger to world-welfare.</p>

<p>Reversing the stereotyped text-book arrangement,
we place our questions at the beginning
<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a id="Page_90"></a></span>
rather than at the end of this chapter. Every
thoughtful woman is begged to stop and answer
these questions,&mdash;in writing, if feasible,&mdash;as fully
and as honestly as possible, and then, after carefully
studying the subject, to see if her opinions
have altered in any particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two great
movements.</div>

<p>Two of the great movements that are sweeping
over our land,&mdash;the Playground movement
and the movement to create and enforce
proper laws concerning Child Labor,&mdash;are engrossing
the attention of some of our greatest
and wisest men and women. The abundance
of literature on these subjects, the time devoted
to them in great conventions and in lesser gatherings,
the very opposition encountered in the ranks
of those who profit by the exploitation of America’s
growing children,&mdash;all go to prove that they
belong to the living issues of the day. Our
grandmothers would doubtless have been shocked
beyond words to be told that the subject of their
children’s play belonged to the “Child Problems”
studied by the country at large through its
Juvenile Commission, and had become a matter
for legislation and financial appropriation by state
and municipality! But so it is, and Hygiene
and Psychology and various other learned sciences
each claim a voice in the subject of the play and
the work of the nation’s children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The importance
of play.</div>

<p>A few extracts from earnest writers and thinkers
on this subject will illustrate their view point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="91"><a id="Page_91"></a></span>
All animals play. Play is likewise one of the fundamental
instincts of the child. If there are any inherent
rights of childhood, the right to play must be considered
one of them. It carries with it immeasurable benefits,
but the exact results still remain comparatively uncertain.
It is unquestionable, however, that play promotes the
physical and mental development of the child, and that
it is no mean factor in his social and moral elevation....
The ancient attitude toward play was that of toleration
of the ebullient spirits of the growing boy.... The utilitarian
function of play was undreamed of. The physical
weakness of the child and his incapacity for concentrated
thought and endeavor saved to him the enjoyment of
play until his parents could use his services in some
gainful occupation.... Play&mdash;the most enjoyable right
of childhood&mdash;was unduly curtailed, and even at the
present day its value is minimized by many who do not
recognize its varied functions....</p>

<p>Whatever be the correct theory of play&mdash;that it is
practice in the line of future methods of conduct, that it
is simply the discharge of the surplus energy of the young,
or that it is for the purpose of relaxation and recreation
only&mdash;whatever theory be adopted, the inestimable
value of play to the child and to the nation cannot be
gainsaid. Play is an irrepressible method of self-expression....</p>

<p>The social and moral influences of play produce indelible
effects upon the child mind.... The recognition of
mutual rights is one of its initial values. These rights
are but little understood by the unthinking child, and
when brute force permits, are often entirely overthrown
or perverted into a mere toleration of privileges.... On
the supervised playground a new regime is put into operation....
The growth of the instinct of co-operation is
perhaps the most valuable result of play.... Ability to
co-operate spells ability to excel.<a id="Anchor-28" title="Go to Footnote 28" href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Jane Addams
on Play.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="92"><a id="Page_92"></a></span>
Miss Jane Addams of Hull House, Chicago,
speaks with no uncertain sound and with undisputed
authority on this subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This stupid experiment of organizing work and failing
to organize play has, of course, brought about a fine
revenge. The love of pleasure will not be denied, and,
when it has turned into all sorts of malignant and vicious
appetites, then we, the middle aged, grow quite distracted,
and resort to all sorts of restrictive measures.
We even try to dam up the sweet fountain itself because
we are affrighted by these neglected streams; but almost
worse than the restrictive measures is our apparent belief
that the city itself has no obligation in the matter, an
assumption upon which the modern city turns over to
commercialism practically all the provisions for public
recreation.<a id="Anchor-29" title="Go to Footnote 29" href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Professor <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John on the
little girl and
her doll.</div>

<p>Singling out one type of the play instinct, the
little girl and her doll, Professor <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of
the Hartford School of Religious Pedagogy <span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Altruistic feeling had its origin in motherhood, and it
has reached no greater heights of self-denial and service
than in that same relationship. In playing with her doll
the child is in thought and feeling making that experience
her own. At a very formative period of her life it gives
her much the same training that the race has received
through the actual experience.... Every impulse toward
loving care of the doll should be encouraged. To the
child in her play it is a living child, and hence the experience
provides the same kind of emotional training that
would come from the care of a baby, without the obvious
disadvantages to the infant.</p>

<p>Kate Douglas Wiggin says, “Every mother knows the
<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a id="Page_93"></a></span>
development of tenderness and motherliness that goes on
in her little girl through the nursing and petting and
teaching and caring for her doll.”<a id="Anchor-30" title="Go to Footnote 30" href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we agree with an axiom laid down in the
first chapter (<a title="Go to page 7" href="#Page_7"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7</a>) of this book, that one of the
inalienable rights of every child is to follow his
instinct for healthful play, it is now our privilege
and pleasure to watch the little ones of many
lands with their tripping feet and merry voices
and lithe little bodies. We instinctively turn
to Japan, “the paradise of children,” where annually
at the “Feast of Dolls” the whole home
becomes a big playhouse for the girls of the
family, and where the “Feast of Flags” is the
day dedicated to the boys of the nation. We
certainly must stop long enough to see what is
done at these feasts.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Feast of Dolls.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>And then there is the feast most loved in the whole
year, the Feast of Dolls, when on the third day of the
third month the great fire-proof store-house gives forth
its treasures of dolls,&mdash;in an old family, many of them
hundreds of years old,&mdash;and for three days, with all their
belongings of tiny furnishings, in silver, lacquer, and
porcelain, they reign supreme, arranged on red-covered
shelves in the finest room of the house. Most prominent
among the dolls are the effigies of the Emperor and
Empress in antique court costume, seated in dignified
calm, each on a lacquered dais. Near them are the
figures of the five court musicians in their robes of office,
each with his instrument. Beside these dolls, which are
always present and form the central figures at the feast,
<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a id="Page_94"></a></span>
numerous others, more plebeian, but more lovable, find
places on the lower shelves, and the array of dolls’ furnishings
which is brought out on these occasions is something
marvelous....</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote3">Feast of Flags.</div>

<blockquote class="sn">
<p>As the Feast of Dolls is to the girls, so is the Feast of
Flags to the boys,&mdash;their own special day, set apart for
them out of the whole year. It comes on the fifth day
of the fifth month.... When the great day at last arrives,
the feast within the home is conducted in much the same
way as the Feast of Dolls. There are the same red-covered
shelves, the same offerings of food and drink;
but instead of the placid images of the Emperor and
Empress and the five court musicians, the household
furnishings, and toilet articles, there are effigies of the
heroes of history and folk-lore.... Behind each figure
stands a flag with the crest of the hero in miniature.
The food offered is mochi wrapped in oak leaves, because
the oak is among trees what the carp is among fishes, the
emblem of strength and endurance. The flower of the
day is the iris or flag, because of its sword-shaped leaves,&mdash;hence
the name, Shobu Matsuri, feast of iris or flag.<a id="Anchor-31" title="Go to Footnote 31" href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Playground
movement in
Japan.</div>

<p>It is a matter for heartfelt rejoicing that the
Japanese Government has seized upon the idea
of the Playground Movement as one of the really
essential activities of some of the great Christian
nations, and is introducing playgrounds for the
benefit of Japanese children, who certainly deserve
a suitable place and opportunity to follow
their instinct for play. We hope that hammocks
and sandpiles for babies will soon eliminate one
feature of the play hour which is described by
many missionaries and tourists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="95"><a id="Page_95"></a></span>
“We have such hosts of children here in
Tokyo,” writes Mrs. J. K. McCauley. “We
go out and see boys on high stilts, with babies on
their backs, and we tremble lest they fall and drop
the baby; but I have never heard of one who
did; and we see girls, jumping the rope with
babies on their backs, and playing battledore
and shuttlecock, dodging, hopping, stooping, and
the wee baby’s head bobbing up and down,
laughing, and sometimes crying; but the playing
goes on, winter, summer, no matter how cold,
unless raining or snowing. The streets swarm
with children, with bright colored kimonos,
bright eyes, rosy cheeks, and on wooden shoes,
making such a clatter; but seldom are they
noisy in their play, but fun-loving as any children
in the world!”<a id="Anchor-32" title="Go to Footnote 32" href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Other lands
feel the need of
play.</div>

<p>That other lands than Japan are beginning
to be aroused on the subject of Child Play by
America’s example is proved by the fact that in
April, 1913, letters were received by the Playground
and Recreation Association of America
from Persia, Russia, China, and Uruguay regarding
recreation in those countries. The suggestion
is made that perhaps as Rome gave to the
world law, and Greece gave art, so America may
contribute play as her share towards the world’s
progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Games that
are known the
world over.</div>

<p>There are some games that seem to be as instinctive
to mankind as are the processes of
<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a id="Page_96"></a></span>
eating and sleeping. Kites, tops, and marbles
appear at their proper seasons in Korea, India,
and Persia, the rules of “Hop-Scotch,” “tag,”
“hide and seek,” “crack the whip” seem to be
very similar whether played by the Lao children
or European immigrant children on an American
pavement. Jack-stones and “Fox and Geese”
are popular among the small, bound-footed girls
in China. The rhythmic movement and exciting
choices of “London Bridge” are recognized in
the very heart of Africa in a game so prettily
described by Miss Jean McKenzie that we long
to join in the fun.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">African
“London
Bridge.”</div>

<blockquote>
<p>A mother and her children file under the arms of two
players. The child caught is drawn aside for the choice
between a cake of gourd seed or a peanut porridge, a
necklace of beads or a bow and arrow&mdash;we all know the
phantom bliss of such choices. The children are caught
and ranged until there remains none but the mother
and one who is now called “the only child.” This remnant
of a once numerous family takes to the bush, but
the mother sallies forth from time to time and tosses a
handful of grass toward the company, who ask her in
chorus:</p>

<p>“How big is the only child now?”</p>

<p>“The only child creeps,” says the mother.</p>

<p>“Hay-a-a!” exclaims the astonished chorus after this
and all other complacent maternal announcements.</p>

<p>“How old is the only child now?”</p>

<p>“The only child walks.”</p>

<p>“Hay-a-a!”</p>

<p>To this chorus of astonished approval, the only child
comes to be a young girl, has a sweetheart, is married,
and has a baby!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="97"><a id="Page_97"></a></span>
Having achieved so much success, the only child ceases
to figure in this drama, and the grandmother is plied
with questions about the child of the only child.</p>

<p>“How old is the child of the only child now?”</p>

<p>“The child of the only child creeps.”</p>

<p>“Hay-a-a!”</p>

<p>He walks, he sets traps, one day he has killed a little
antelope, another day he has killed a big antelope, and
now he has killed an elephant!</p>

<p>Here surely is a climax. “Hay-a-a!” The chorus
disintegrates; one after another comes to beg a piece of
elephant meat from the child of the only child, who
emerges from hiding. One after another is refused, until
that one comes who pleases the child of the only child.
He gives her a piece of elephant meat for a sign that she
is his sweetheart&mdash;and they are obliged, of course, to
run away. After them the entire company is, of course,
obliged to follow.</p>

<p>Here, you see, is a rehearsal of life as it is to be. Here
is the dissension, the gossip, the greed, the romance, and
the adventure of life.<a id="Anchor-33" title="Go to Footnote 33" href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">African
children’s play.</div>

<p>“Kidd in his book on ‘Savage Childhood’
describes the Bantu children of Africa as showing
great power of imagination in their games. Before
the missionary they appear dull and unresponsive,
but when no stranger is about they
delight in playing missionary, holding a play
service, singing hymns, and mimicking the padre’s
bad dialect. The insistence of the motor idea is
strong in the native; he likes to play games involving
motor skill, is fond of acrobatic tricks, of
mimicking animals, and delights in dolls and
<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a id="Page_98"></a></span>
play animals. In fact, the whole picture is that
of an intensely human little animal, decidedly
attractive, and one feels pity that it should grow
up into an unattractive and troublesome Kaffir
problem.”<a id="Anchor-34" title="Go to Footnote 34" href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Children of the
desert at play.</div>

<p>How invariably true is the child’s instinct for
imitation, for making his play largely a “rehearsal
of life as it is to be.” The little Bedouin
boys, each with a pet locust harnessed to a bit
of string, enjoy the exciting races of their “fiery
steeds,” and prepare eagerly for the great game
in which the bigger boys show their budding
manhood. A dweller in the region of the Dead
Sea thus describes some of the games of the
desert:</p>

<p>“The boys of the desert are glad when the first
of the month comes. For that day their fathers
allow them to have a horse each and ride away
from their black tent homes into the open desert,
their athletic field. A few of the men, heroes of
the tribe, meet there with the boys and act as
judges in the horse-racing. They divide the
boys in two rows, and then select a boy from each
side, and start off this first pair in their race (on
horseback) to the distant goal, a pole with a
prize on it such as eggs, money, or clothes. The
one who arrives first takes the prize off the pole
or knocks it down with his staff. The judge
keeps the conqueror on one side, the conquered
<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a id="Page_99"></a></span>
on the other. A new prize is put up, another pair
races, and so on till all the victors are on one side,
and the poor defeated ones on the other.</p>

<p>“A sham battle takes place, the conquerors
shooting the conquered with paper or some harmless
shot. Then the beaten soldiers are taken
captive and led to their homes, while the proud
victors are allowed to go to the meeting place of
the men and drink coffee with the heroes of their
tribe.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why play stops
so early in
non-Christian
lands.</div>

<p>All too soon the games of childhood merge
into the stern realities of life, and, as we watch
and listen and smile, we suddenly wonder why
the laughter is hushed, why the smiling, girlish
lips are covered by a woman’s thick veil, why the
little backs stoop beneath loads far too heavy
for them. Then from far and near comes the
testimony of those who have lived and worked
among the children in non-Christian lands.
The physical director of a <abbr title="Young Men’s Christian Association">Y. M. C. A.</abbr> says:&mdash;“One
of the strongest impressions made on me in
China was by the lack of opportunity which the
average child has for normal physical development
and for the adequate expression of its play
instinct.”</p>

<p>Deaconess Phelps of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilda’s School for
girls in Hankow says: “When Chinese girls
come to our mission schools we find it difficult
to teach them how to play, and in the case of
elder children we often fail completely, because
from time immemorial the idea of learning and
<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a id="Page_100"></a></span>
scholarship has been entirely inconsistent with
fun and good times.”<a id="Anchor-35" title="Go to Footnote 35" href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>So great an authority as <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Arthur H. Smith
says: “The outdoor games of Chinese children
are mostly of a tame and uninteresting type.
Even in the country Chinese lads do not appear
to take kindly to anything which involves much
exercise. Their jumping and climbing are of
the most elementary sort.”<a id="Anchor-36" title="Go to Footnote 36" href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Napier Malcolm after discussing the play
life of Persian children adds:</p>

<p>“But when all is said, the games and toys are
very few in Persia as compared to those you are
accustomed to. No great distinction is made
between children and grown-ups, and really
there is not so much difference as we find at
home. The children are taught to take life
very seriously ... and they have no time to
grow up into proper men and women. The
result is that we find the children too grown-up
and the grown-ups too childish.”<a id="Anchor-37" title="Go to Footnote 37" href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of the

<p>“Little old men and women” the missionary
called them in her plea that to the children of
India might be brought the gift of <strong class="fakesc">CHILDHOOD</strong>,
and so we must not be surprised that our

one of the most essential and one of the most

been at it for many years in a quiet, unpretentious
way, these pioneers of thought and
action. Now that the whole American public is
being aroused as never before to the value and
need of play for <em>all</em> children, let us see to it that
all necessary facilities are in the hands of our
missionaries, and that their numbers are sufficiently
reinforced so that the “Spirit of Play”
may flit from land to land and bring smiles and
joy and health and lessons of unselfishness and
co-operation to little children who have long
since forgotten how to play.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parents ought
to know how to
play.</div>

<p>Not only because they are children today, but
because they will in a few short years become
parents, must we give the little ones this opportunity.
If the fathers and mothers of the near
future know how to value the development of
the play instinct at its true worth, there is great
hope for their children. If they can enter
into the play spirit with their boys and girls,
there will be a revolution in home ideals and
companionships. That the lesson is not an
easy one to learn or to teach, we are assured
by Elizabeth Harrison, who says, “How many
parents and teachers are there who can enter
into this world of play and not spoil it? In
my classes for mothers I have found that one of
the most difficult things I have had to teach
many of them has been how to play simply and
genuinely as a child will play.”</p>

<p>But whether the parents themselves know how
<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a id="Page_102"></a></span>
to play or not, the quickest and surest way into
their hearts is through sympathy with the play
instinct of a little child. The missionary who
can enter into even that realm of the life of a
child has the wondering appreciation of the
parent. A little mountain girl lay dangerously
ill at the girls’ school in Urumia, Persia. The
principal, who was tenderly caring for her in
her own room, came to ask if by any chance I
knew how to get hold of a dollie for the little
child, who had seen such a toy in the possession
of a missionary’s child. Yes, a thoughtful friend
had tucked a couple of dolls into one of my
boxes for just such an emergency, and the one
whose head had survived the eight thousand mile
journey was found and sent to the little girl.
Such rapturous smiles, such motherly hugs and
caresses, such appreciation when her schoolmates
gave up their recreation hours in order to
make proper Persian clothes to replace the queer
American garments! And when the little one
went to be with Him who “gathers the lambs
in His arms,” her weeping parents selected according
to custom her chief treasure to lay into
the casket,&mdash;in this instance, the cheap little
American doll that had travelled so far to bring
joy to the heart of a dying child. Up into the
rugged Kurdish mountains the crude casket was
carried on the back of a sure-footed horse, and at
every village where there were friends of the
family the caravan was halted for a last glimpse
<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a id="Page_103"></a></span>
of the little face and a wondering look at the
fascinating toy. “How they must have loved
her!” was the text from which the doll preached
many a sermon that day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of public

<p>In order that the “Spirit of Play” may have
full right of way, a great, united, preliminary
effort is needed, that the little ones of all lands
may come into their rightful heritage. What
time, what strength, what zest is there left for
play when the children have to work and contribute
toward the family support? With shame
we confess that the Christian nations are far
from guiltless in this matter,&mdash;the blood of
thousands of their children cries to God from
the ground. But, thank God, they are <em>aroused</em>,
and changes are taking place with wonderful
rapidity, and nations like China and Japan are
<em>looking to us</em> as examples. Shall we fail them
in their hour of crisis, or shall we lead and help
and encourage them and other lands awaking
from age-long sleep in this matter of their duty
to the children?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prominent among the rights of the child must be the
right to abstain from the task of earning money either
for his own support or to increase the family income.
Premature child labor is an absolute evil and is wholly
without justification.... The enlightened view of today
refuses to regard the child as a mere commercial asset of
the parent. On the contrary, the relation of the two is
exactly reversed. Until children reach a certain age it is
absolutely necessary that they be supported by their
parents, and society must enforce this obligation.<a id="Anchor-38" title="Go to Footnote 38" href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote2">The little

<blockquote>
<p>But for the horrors of child labor in the carpet trade we
must turn to the factories of Kirman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="106"><a id="Page_106"></a></span>
These factories are filled with children from four years
old upward, underfed, overworked, living a loveless,
joyless, hopeless life. The factories are built without
windows lest the children’s attention should be distracted,
and the bad air, want of food, and the constantly keeping
in one position produce rickets and deformity in nearly
all. Of thirty-eight children examined in one factory,
thirty-six were deformed.</p>

<p>One of the Governors of Kirman forbade the employment
of children under twelve in the factories, but the
order did not last beyond his governorship. The same
Governor gave the order still in force, which forbids the
employment of children before dawn or after sunset,
thus reducing their working hours to an average of twelve
hours a day. A recent Governor added to this an order
limiting the Friday work to about two and a half hours,
“from sunrise to full sunshine,” so now the children share
in part the general Friday holiday of Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>One of our medical missionaries was called to attend
the wife of the owner of one of these factories, and consented
to do so on condition he made windows in his
factory to allow the children air and light. He objected
at first, saying that it would prevent their working, but
finally consented, and admitted afterwards that the children
did more work with the windows than they had done
without them.</p>

<p>The factory owners are glad to get the children, for
they say children work better than grown-up people at
carpet-making, and of course they expect less wages.
But how can the parents allow their children to live this
cruel life? You will find the answer in the Persian saying
that “of every three persons in Kirman, four smoke
opium.”... Over and over again comes the terrible
story, the father and mother smoke opium; the little
deformed child toils through the long days to earn the
money that buys it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="107"><a id="Page_107"></a></span>
Is the picture sad enough, are the colors
gloomy enough, are the weary cries loud enough
to reach and touch every womanly heart in a
Christian land,&mdash;every mother or sister or
teacher who has ever loved or helped or taught
a child? Ah, but we must go into darker depths
than these if we are to be even ordinarily intelligent
concerning child life and its needs. What of
the little slave children who are stolen from their
homes “in darkest Africa,” who are sold by their
parents in China and Assam, who live lives of unspeakable
misery in Korea, in Siam, in Turkey,
Morocco, and Arabia? Paid child labor is terrible
enough, but the countless slave children
of the world live under a far more cruel system.</p>

<p>In his revelations concerning “The Crime of
the Congo,” A. Conan Doyle gives proof of the
atrocious crimes perpetrated on little children
as well as on men and women by employees of
the Congo government. The selling, beating,
mutilation, and murder of children were proved
to be common occurrences.</p>

<p>It is said to be difficult for even the missionaries
to realize the awful extent of the traffic in
girls in China. In famine times girls may be
bought for a mere song, sometimes being peddled
about the streets in a basket and sold like poultry.
In Siam the problem of slavery has assumed
such large proportions that the king
issued an edict a few years ago that thereafter
all children born of slaves should be free.</p>

ladies, and the result was the opening
of a home for slave children under the direction
of a committee on which the missionaries and the
foreign residents were represented. After four
years they were able to report the presence of
fifteen girls, most of them very young and looking
even younger than they really were because
stunted by harsh treatment and lack of sufficient
food. Not a child in the home but had been
taken from a life of pain and cruel hardship, and
none is too wretched or maimed or low to be
<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a id="Page_109"></a></span>

Miss Muir of the Methodist Episcopal Mission
in China.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One year ago last spring <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> B. was called to see a little
slave girl in one of China’s most prominent official’s
families. She was five years old. She was caught napping
when she should have been fanning one of the young
ladies of the family. This young lady, sixteen years old,
a spoiled pet, struck the child over the head and face,
leaving deep scars, tied her hands and feet together, and
threw scalding water upon her. When <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> B. saw her
he persuaded them to let her go to the Hospital, where
her feet and all fingers except the stump of her right
thumb had to be amputated. Then <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> B. wanted to
put her into the school, and so he told this official he
would have to settle a certain amount of money on her
for life or he (<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> B.) would expose him to the public
and the foreign countries where he had lived. After he
had tried in every way to creep out of it, <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> B. holding
fast, $3000.00 was settled upon the child as long as she
lives, but whatever has not been spent of it at her death
goes back to the family. This is poor little Mary, who
is compelled to walk on her knees the rest of her life just
because she was too sleepy to keep awake one afternoon
when only five years old. But her influence in the school
cannot be estimated. Her being there has helped to
soften and make more kind and thoughtful every girl
from the oldest to the youngest. It is beautiful to watch
<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a id="Page_110"></a></span>
the little ones try to carry her or pick her up when she
falls. It has been the redemption of “Pontsi” (Fattie),
who used to be the mischief of the school: she would not
study for any teacher, and was the hopeless case of every
one. “Pontsi” appointed herself the guardian and caretaker
of Mary as soon as Mary came to school; she is
Mary’s partner in the line; she wheels Mary in her little
chair; helps her up and down from the bench in chapel; and
is always alert to do the many little helpful things where
Mary needs help. She has become very studious and
good in her classes, no more in mischief. But Mary has
such a bright, happy disposition that she is a great help
to herself, and many a time will beat half a dozen with
two good feet running across the compound on her knees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defective and

<p>We started our chapter with children at play;
we found that all too soon in countless instances
the play must cease and hard grinding work
must begin; we learned that in many lands great
masses of little children are in hopeless slavery.
One other large group of pathetic little ones
claims our attention, sympathy, and help in
this connection,&mdash;children who know little or
nothing of play and fun and laughter,&mdash;for whom
no provision is made in lands where Christ is
not known. These are the defective and dependent
children,&mdash;cripples, deaf mutes, the
blind, orphans, famine waifs, children of lepers.
Why is it that until missionaries started to work
for these classes of children, or governments
were inspired to such efforts by the examples of
Christian governments, there was no chance or
hope for the great mass of defective and dependent
children in non-Christian lands? Why is it
<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a id="Page_111"></a></span>
that blind girls in Korea had no other prospect
than that of being sold to be trained as sorceresses,
or that parents of blind Chinese girls
find a ready market for them in brothels?
Search diligently and find out if you can what
would have become of the famine waifs of India
and China, or the massacre orphans of Turkey,
had not Christian missionaries considered their
need a call to new and more difficult service, and
had not Christians in Europe and America heard
and answered the call for more funds to support
the new work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Armenian
massacre orphans.</div>

<p>The Armenian massacres in 1894&ndash;96 cast some
fifty thousand children in Turkey without warning
onto the care of the missionaries, who had
to face the alternative of letting these children
die or drift hopelessly into lives of wretchedness
and vice, or else of caring for them in some
adequate, systematic way. Many pages might
be written to show how Christian missions rose
to the occasion, but one instance must suffice
as an illustration of the task, how it was met,
and its consequences. We quote from a letter
written in 1912 by <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> George C. Reynolds,
<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a id="Page_112"></a></span>
<abbr title="Doctor of Medicine">M. D.</abbr>, for forty-four years a missionary in Van,
Turkey.</p>

<p>“In 1896 occurred the great massacre, when
for a week our premises became the place of
refuge for the Armenians, of which from 10,000
to 15,000 availed themselves. And then our
streets became filled with helpless orphans,
whose plaintive cry for help we tried to voice as
an appeal to Christian philanthropy in America
and Europe. Thank God, the appeal brought
response, and we were enabled to gather in a
few of these helpless waifs to feed and shelter
and clothe and educate in books and trades.
For fifteen years this God-given work was continued,
and several temporary buildings were
erected for its accommodation. When our German
friends withdrew their part of the institution
to separate quarters, promising sufficient
orphanage provision for the province, the American
Orphanage was allowed to pass into history;
but we feel as we review this history, that this
effort at least was worth while. Nearly a
thousand children were rescued from the streets
to find a loving Christian home, and the elevation
which it gave them over the mass of even well-to-do
villagers from among whom most of them
were taken might almost make them thankful
for the massacre. Forty-five of the five hundred
and seventy-five boys have graduated
from our high school, thirty-nine of whom have
given some years of their lives to teaching. A
<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a id="Page_113"></a></span>
good number have continued their studies in
higher institutions in this country or abroad.
Two have secured the degree of <abbr title="Doctor of Medicine">M. D.</abbr> in America,
and are engaged in successful practice of
their profession there, while others are on their
way to the same goal. One has just taken his
<abbr title="Doctor of Medicine">M. D.</abbr> degree from Edinburgh University, and
another is soon to graduate from London University,
while three or four are successfully pursuing
university studies at Harvard. Three
have graduated from colleges in Turkey. Political
and economic conditions in this land not
being attractive, many have emigrated, of whom
fifty are now in the United States, and two in
South America. Most of these are fully making
good. This orphanage episode of my life brings
me much of joy and satisfaction.”</p>

<p>Reports full of thrilling interest come to hand
concerning the work of Christian orphanages in
non-Christian lands,&mdash;institutions founded and
maintained by those who consider it their privilege
to act as the human agents of Him who is
the “Father of the fatherless.” We are told
that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s Orphanage maintained in Shanghai,
China, by the Episcopal Board of Missions
has been dubbed by the Chinese, “The Polishing
Jade Establishment,” which is a reference to
their own classic teaching that as jade must be
cut and polished to be of value, so children must
be taught and trained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Orphanages
in India.</div>

<p>The plan of establishment of orphanages in
India under the Methodist Episcopal Mission
dates back to 1857, and is a fine example of how
Christian missionaries are on the lookout for
suitable openings for work, and how to them is
apt to be granted the far vision that labors for
the present and future generations and for
eternity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The orphanage for girls was first established in the
city of Lucknow, but up to the close of 1860 only thirteen
orphans had been received. Owing to the famine that
spread over the land after the great mutiny, it became
<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a id="Page_115"></a></span>
an easy matter to secure girls, and the following year
the number increased to forty-one.... At the close of
the mutiny, <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Butler made application to the government
for a number of girls to be placed in the orphanage,
to be cared for by the mission. The government was
very willing that the children should be thus provided
for.... <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Butler says:</p>

<p>“Upon reaching the city we found that the Mohammedan
officers connected with the magistrate’s court, at
whose disposal the girls had been placed, had distributed
many of them in houses of infamy throughout the city
to be brought up to a life of sin. This matter was presented
to the governor, and the children were ordered
to be immediately recovered and forwarded to the mission.
They were sent in large carts, each containing
twenty girls. The oldest was probably twelve or thirteen
years, the youngest a mere babe; but three-fourths of
them were under eleven years of age. Each driver had
his list for his load. He lifted out the largest one first
and laid her down, then the rest, placing them around
her as if building them into a bee-hive shape. Then
the heaps were counted and the signature affixed to each
list, and the carts moved out.</p>

<p>“The children were all untidy, and their countenances
bore the traces of the hunger through which they had
passed.... But these were girls, and the glad thought
was that they were our own to save and train and elevate.
We accepted them as a trust from God. All hands were
soon at work in loving labor to change the aspect of
things. The missionary women and their native helpers
before the sun went down had accomplished a delightful
transformation. Bodies were washed, clean clothing put
on, and a hearty meal of wholesome food banished the
gloomy looks and brought forth the first smiles on those
little faces.”<a id="Anchor-44" title="Go to Footnote 44" href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

Not only are orphanages established, but missionaries
use many other means to provide for
helpless, dependent, or neglected children who
are thrown on their care. After one of India’s
great famines the <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> Rockwell Clancy of
Allahabad formed a distributing station for
famine waifs and collected and placed hundreds
of them in various schools and institutions
throughout the land. A new missionary to
China after only a month’s study of the language
had rather an interesting trip with his collection
of famine orphans. He <span class="nowrap">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The trip to Nanking, including a ten-mile
trip on the Presbyterian motor boat to the railroad
station and the one hundred miles by rail,
was full of wonders to these little country lads.
On the cars when eating our slim lunch, consisting
of a bun and a boiled egg for each boy, one
of the boys who was a little older than most of
them politely offered part of his share to the
people who were occupying the same seat with
him, and this in spite of the fact that he had
been going hungry for weeks or months.</p>

<p>“After entering the city wall at Nanking we
drove the seven miles to a rented Chinese house
where I was living, which was to serve as their
home for the time being. One of the drivers told
the boys that we were going to dig out their
eyes and cut out their stomachs. This awesome
news, coupled with a little homesickness, was
probably the cause of two of them running away
<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a id="Page_117"></a></span>
the very next day. We had to send four or five
to the Methodist hospital to be treated, and two
of the older boys who were allowed to go along
ran away. But their places have been filled
by three others, two of whom I had to leave in
the hospital at Hwai Yuan.”<a id="Anchor-45" title="Go to Footnote 45" href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>What provision is there for the blind, the deaf
and dumb, the crippled children in non-Christian
lands? Would you care to know the number of
children whose fate is like that of the Mohammedan
girl who was brought by her grandmother
to the missionary dispensary in Persia? She
was deaf, dumb, and blind, and her grandmother
pleaded with the lady physician to do something
to cure her. The girl shrank in fright as a
strange hand touched her and then every tense
muscle in her body showed amazement and relief
when the hand proved to be gentle and loving.
Again the grandmother brought her, saying,
“You <em>must</em> find a remedy. There is nothing we
can do with her. Must I kill her?” and the missionary’s
heart was broken because she could
not cure and there was absolutely no institution
to which to take the girl. Some years later a
younger deaf and dumb girl was brought to
the dispensary by a woman whose face seemed
familiar and who turned out to be the despairing
old grandmother. “Where is the older girl?”
asked the doctor. “Oh,” exclaimed the old
<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a id="Page_118"></a></span>
woman, while the tears rained down her face, “I
had to kill her. There was nothing else to do!”</p>

<p>Who knows what there was behind that wall
of blindness and deafness,&mdash;who knows what
might have been the result had the Mohammedan
Helen Keller had her fair chance? Which
members of the “organized motherhood for the
children of the world” will see to it that there
are means and workers enough to give these
children their inalienable rights? The work is
barely begun, but is full of promise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blind children
in India.</div>

<p>“According to the last census, the number of
blind persons in the Indian Empire is 600,000.
Little was done for them until Miss Asquith,
superintendent of the school for Tamil girls in
Palamcotta, founded a school for blind children
a few years ago. Her success was so great that
she resigned her lucrative position and gave herself
and all her time to the care of the blind.
Now the English Government will aid her in
the erection of two substantial school buildings,
one for boys, the other for girls, that she may give
both a more complete education.”<a id="Anchor-46" title="Go to Footnote 46" href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Work for the

<p>“The Martha A. King Memorial School for the
Deaf has been started as a department of the
work of the Woman’s Board of Missions at
Marsovan. The oral method is used, and it is
the intention to teach each pupil the language of
his own home. The present year the Greek department
<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a id="Page_119"></a></span>
has been opened, an Armenian department
will be opened in September, 1911, and one
in Turkish as soon as there is a demand for it.</p>

<p>“Children (both boys and girls) will be received
at from six to eight years of age. Older
children may be accepted, but it is important
for the attainment of the best results that pupils
begin the work within the age limits named.
Miss Philadelpheus, the teacher, has spent two
years at the Clark School for the Deaf, Northampton,
<abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, in preparation for this work.
Both the home and school life of the children are
under the most careful supervision.”<a id="Anchor-47" title="Go to Footnote 47" href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Deaf and dumb
school in
China.</div>

<p>One in every five hundred of China’s vast
population is estimated to be deaf and dumb.
The <em>only</em> school in China for such unfortunates
is in Chefoo and was started in 1898 as an independent
work by Mrs. A. T. Mills, for many years
a member of the Presbyterian Mission, which
heartily approves of the school, but has no funds
with which to support it. Boys and girls are
taught in this school to read, write, and speak,
and are given as much elementary knowledge
as is possible, while being trained to useful occupations
by which they may hope to be self-supporting.
Such constructive work for children
who are handicapped is considered absolutely
necessary in America and Europe. Is
there in your opinion any necessity for multiplying
such agencies in non-Christian lands?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A peculiarly bright, happy-looking girl of about
eighteen, sitting down at the beginning of the morning in
one of our Amritsar dispensaries, with her large Gospel
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Matthew, in <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Moon’s system of raised characters
for the blind, open on her knees; she can see nothing,
but her fingers move swiftly across the page, and she
begins to read better than some persons who have the
use of their eyes! As the morning goes on, all the sick
who come for medicine will listen with astonishment and
pleasure, and she will have opportunities of witnessing
for Jesus to those who ask her a reason for the hope that
is in her. She was once herself in the darkness of Mohammedanism,
and in the Blind School found Christ.
She is now a rejoicing and consistent Christian. Do
you think that, as we stood and watched her delight in
reading the comfortable words of our Saviour Christ, we
asked ourselves if to bring such to the Lord were work
worth doing? Rather, is it not a service which angels
might envy?”<a id="Anchor-48" title="Go to Footnote 48" href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A leprous
mother.</div>

<p>A leprous mother, outcast of society, doomed
to spend the rest of her life in a leper village
and to drag out a miserable existence among those
who are afflicted and suffering like herself!
What, oh what, shall she do with her children,
as yet untainted by the frightful disease, but sure
to develop it if they too go to the leper village?
And yet who is there in the wide world to care for
her little ones? Her husband is up at the village,
<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a id="Page_121"></a></span>
hands gone, sightless eyes, disfigured face,&mdash;he
cannot help. No relatives or neighbors will
be bothered with the children of the outcast,
and yet that mother heart beats with an intense,
despairing mother love as yours or mine might,&mdash;with
a love that can bear all suffering and even
slow death for herself if only her children are safe.
Hark, a neighbor calls to her from a safe distance,&mdash;“Do
you know that those foreign Jesus
people have a place where they take the children
of those who are accursed of God like yourself?
They take them and feed them and teach them
their Jesus religion and train them to earn their
living.” Oh, it is the one word of hope and
courage, the one ray of light in utter darkness,
and the little children are left on the threshold
of the Home for Untainted Children, and the
leper mother learns of a Home where she herself
may go and where she and her husband may
receive loving care and unheard-of comfort, and
where the years of suffering are illumined by the
knowledge of another Home where she may
meet her darlings once more, and “where the
inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a id="Page_122"></a></span>
record of the work of Christian missions thus far.
Compare with it the record of what in this modern
day has been done in the name of an attempt at
civilization which leaves Christianity entirely out
of account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the name of
civilization, but
without
Christianity.</div>

<p>“Wellesley G. Bailey of Edinburgh, the superintendent
of the Mission to Lepers, has received
authoritative information concerning the terrible
massacre of lepers by government soldiers which
was perpetrated at the city of Nanning, the remote
capital of the province Kwang-si in southern
China. The massacre was instituted under
the direct orders of the governor general of the
province.... In this case the offense of his
cruelty is aggravated by the fact that, taking
advantage of the trend to modern ideas in China,
the vicious old general pretended to be acting in
the interest of scientific hygiene. The excuse
he has made for the massacre is that leprosy is a
great menace to humanity and the destruction of
those afflicted with it is the surest way of stamping
out the scourge....</p>

<p>“The English Missionaries had been anxious
for some time to build a leper hospital, but could
not spare the energy for it from their other work.
And for a long time the Catholics seemed entirely
indifferent to the needs of lepers. But finally,
there arrived in the latter mission a very earnest
and sympathetic priest, whose attention was
early attracted to the collection of miserable
hovels outside the city, where the community of
<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a id="Page_123"></a></span>
suffering had drawn together a larger group of
outcast lepers. The priest determined that something
must be done for them....</p>

<p>“But it appears that the intrusion of the French
into the matter angered General Luk so much
that he took measures immediately to dispose of
the question in another way. Soldiers were
sent out to dig a deep trench near by the leper
village, and early on a Saturday morning soon
after a large body of troops completely surrounded
the lepers’ wretched huts. Shouts
brought them out of the door of their hovels, and
immediately the soldiers opened fire, shooting
relentlessly until the whole community&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;were dead or helplessly
wounded. Then the whole mass, many still
living, were dropped into the trench, kerosene
poured over them and the pile set alight. The
victims at this one point numbered fifty-three.
Of course there was immense excitement in the
city, and to defend himself the governor general
issued a proclamation urging that all lepers
should be put out of the way, and advising that
those who did not voluntarily kill themselves
should be killed by their friends and relatives.
How many more died in this way is not known.</p>

<p>“Many crimes have been committed in the
name of civilization, as of liberty, but perhaps
never one quite so monstrous as this in the name
of ‘hygiene.’ Certainly the incident illustrates
<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a id="Page_124"></a></span>
how keenly China needs not civilization simply,
but civilization based upon Christian religion.”<a id="Anchor-50" title="Go to Footnote 50" href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">“The child in

<p>“The child in the midst,” playful, trustful,
loving, helpless, exalted by our Saviour into a
type to be admired and copied if one would enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven! The Master
placed him in the very midst of His disciples,
where he might find shelter, protection, and love.
But today we find the little ones, thousands,
millions of them, in the midst of suffering, neglect,
vice, crime, torture, despair, danger to
body and soul. And ever and anon the Master’s
voice echoes in our ears, “Whosoever shall receive
<em>one</em> such little one in My name, receiveth Me.”</p>

<h3>QUOTATIONS</h3>

<h4>FEAST DAY, ARABIA</h4>

<p>What Christmas Day, with its toys and sweets and
merry-making, is to the Christian child, the Moslem
Feast Day, at the close of the Ramadhan Fast, is to the
little men and women of Arabia. At that time every
child must have a new gown of some bright color. On
that gay day, in the bazaar, are sold delicious sweetmeats
made only on this one occasion in the whole year. Every
one is happy, for the weary month of fasting is at an end.
Friend meets friend with the greeting, “May your feast
be blessed,” and is answered, “May your day be happy.”</p>

<p>Out on the edge of the town, where the houses end and
the desert begins, some enterprising Arab, who has “seen
Bombay,” has constructed the crudest and most dangerous
of Ferris Wheels, and a merry-go-round to match.
Here the youthful inhabitants congregate, with their
<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a id="Page_125"></a></span>
precious coppers, eager for a ride on these wonderful
machines. There are big boys and little boys and middle-sized
boys. There are little girls with their faces uncovered,
and a few older ones with their faces veiled, but most
of the larger girls must stay at home, as it would be a
shame for them to appear in public. There are the
proud sons of the rich Arab merchants, and the children
of the wild Bedouins. What better opportunity could
one have to study the rising generation?</p>

<p>If a Westerner, wearing a hat, passes through the
crowd, he is immediately followed by a mob of impudent,
mischievous boys, calling out in Arabic:</p>

<h4>PLAY, AMONG THE LAO</h4>

<p>We have 110 girls in school this term, over half of them
boarders, and they are so gentle and tractable it is a
pleasure to work with them. It is pitiful to see how little
they know about playing. Their greatest pleasure is
watching us play tennis. A few evenings ago I heard an
unusual noise under my window, and, looking out, saw
a towel tied across the walk between the hedges. On
either side of this stood a girl with a flat stick in her
hand, and they were knocking across the towel a bundle
of rags which they had tied up in some semblance of a
ball. Later we took them out, and let each one have a
few minute’s real play with real racquets and balls, and,
when I put the racquet in a girl’s hand, she would gasp,
as if to say, “Can this be really true, or am I dreaming?”
(Miss Lucy Starling in <cite>Foreign Post</cite>, May, 1910.)</p>

<h4>DOLLS, CENTRAL AFRICA</h4>

<p>The first two dolls that arrived in Toro met with a very
mixed welcome; the children howled and fled in terror,
but their mothers showed a most profound admiration
for them. At first they held the doll very gingerly, but
finding that nothing happened to either one or the other,
and the doll still smiled at them like the Cheshire cat,
they became great friends, and begged that they might
borrow it for a few days to play with.</p>

<p>Whether it was the large circulation that those two
dolls got, or the gradually increasing confidence of the
Toro children in the white ladies, the fact remains that
in a few months all childish prejudice had disappeared,
and often a little voice was heard asking for “a child
that causes play.” When this was known in England,
over one hundred dolls were sent to me from two working
parties. I never saw such a wonderful doll show as they
made. They were all displayed on our verandah, and the
house was literally besieged with men, women, and children
for some days.</p>

<p>A bride, beautifully dressed in white satin and kid shoes,
who even in her wedding attire cried “mamma” and
“papa,” was sent to little Princess Ruth, but the report
reached me that King Kasagama had constituted himself
guardian, and kept it locked up in his study for slack
moments!</p>

<p>Apolo, our faithful native deacon&mdash;confirmed bachelor&mdash;asked
me in secret if men ever played with dolls, and
beamed with satisfaction as he most triumphantly carried
one off, peacefully sleeping.</p>

<p>The others were given out to the little girls who had
been most regular at the school, and were noted for having
come with clean faces and bodies.</p>

<p>When the boys saw that the dolls were only given to girls,
some borrowed their sisters’ garments to try and appear
eligible! I did not know till then they were versed in
<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a id="Page_127"></a></span>
such cunning! It was so pretty to watch the joy and
even playfulness that those dolls brought into the lives
of so many little ones who had scarcely known what this
meant till then. Christianity has completely revolutionized
child-life in Toro.</p>

<h4>SAVING A BOY, CHINA</h4>

<p><abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> F. E. Lund, of Wuhu, tells this incident in connection
with a visit to the out-station at Nanking:</p>

<p>“On going back to the school about ten o’clock at night
I found in a dark corner on the street a poor boy, half
frozen to death. His piteous groaning attracted my
attention. His legs were already numbed and his feet
swollen and covered with chilblains which made him
quite unable to move. He told me he had been driven
out from his home a few days ago, as his father and younger
brother were on the point of starvation. His mother
died last year in the famine. I knew that it was up to
me to save him. There was no one else to do it. The
cold night would have finished him. So I had him carried
to our school, where we gave him a warm bath and
put him into new wadded clothes. During the night he
was in great pain and delirious, but in the morning he
seemed hale and hearty, and proved to be a most straightforward
and clever little man. He is ten years old, but
very small for his age. It was most interesting to see
how heartily our Chinese neighbors endorsed this little
bit of charity. One gave me $2.00 to help pay for the
clothes. Another brought two pairs of socks. Some one
sent a hat, and an innkeeper sent bedding. If we only
had a trade school to put such boys in, we could do a little
work along this line and it would certainly meet with
the approval of the best class, who would be sure to give
substantial help. At any rate, it would be a work that
the best Chinese would appreciate and understand.”
(<cite>Spirit of Missions</cite>, April, 1913.)</p>

<h3>SCRIPTURE READING</h3>

<p class="mem">“The Child in the Midst,” Matthew, 18:1&ndash;6, 10&ndash;14.</p>

<p>Christ commends the humility of the little child and the
spirit of those who receive a child gladly, whether into
the home, the school room, or into any part of their
sphere of influence. There is no place in Christ’s Kingdom
for the one who “does not want to be bothered with
children” or who provokes, injures, neglects, despises, or
causes one little one to sin.</p>

<p>“The feature of child-nature which forms the special
point of comparison is its unpretentiousness. What
children are unconsciously, that Jesus requires His disciples
to be voluntarily and deliberately.” (A. B. Bruce.)</p>


<h3>PRAYER</h3>

<p>Grant, O Heavenly Father, that as Thy holy angels
always behold Thy face in heaven, so they may evermore
protect Thy little ones on earth from all danger, both of
soul and body, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>

<p>Father of the fatherless, let the cry, we pray Thee, of
the orphan and the destitute enter into Thine ears;
rescue them from the perils of a sinful world and bring
them to the refuge of Thy Heavenly Home, for the sake
of Thy Holy Child Jesus, our only Saviour and Redeemer.
Amen.</p>

Four little boys less than ten years of age came
trudging over the muddy Korean road three long
miles to school. In their chilly, little, bare hands
they carried bowls of cold rice for dinner. But
cheerfully they marched along, for the daily
six-mile walk took them to and from the mission
school, and oh! what a wonderful privilege
it was to be able to study,&mdash;a privilege not enjoyed
by all the boys of their village.<a id="Anchor-51" title="Go to Footnote 51" href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The closing session of a school for Jewish

read, instead of growing up to be like donkeys
as we have done!”</p>

<p>A woman in the capital city of Persia, head of
<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a id="Page_134"></a></span>
a Bahaist school, insisted on sending her little
daughter to the American mission school, paying
all tuition charges gladly. “Lady,” she said
to the teacher in charge, “whenever I come into
this school my life is renewed.”</p>

<p>Over the African trail came a young man who
had given his heart to Christ and was now ready
to enter the Bible Training School in order to
fit himself for a life work that no foreign missionary
could hope to accomplish. Earnestly he
<a id="tn_3">pleaded</a> with the missionaries to let him bring his
little eleven-year-old wife to be taught and
trained so that she might some day be a true
help-meet in his work. But there was no boarding
school for girls, no available place for the
child. Think what that future home and work
might have been had the little wife received a
Christian education!</p>

<p>A missionary was returning from an evangelistic
tour over one of the lonely roads of Palestine.
Suddenly he was accosted by several armed men
in disguise, who demanded that he should promise
to grant their request before it was stated to
him. He naturally demurred, but, becoming
convinced that they were not robbers, he finally
consented, realizing that his journey could not
otherwise be continued. Whereupon they demanded
that certain mission schools which had
been closed for lack of funds should be re-opened,
promising to give as much as possible towards
the necessary sum. “It is like depriving our
<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a id="Page_135"></a></span>
children of bread and water and air,” they exclaimed,
“to deprive them of the opportunity for
religious teaching and useful education.”<a id="Anchor-52" title="Go to Footnote 52" href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> A
peaceful missionary held up by a set of masked
bandits in a Mohammedan land, who demanded,
not his money nor his life, but a Christian education
for their children!</p>

<p>Loud and clear and insistent are the voices from
country after country. In many tongues they
call to us Christian women,&mdash;“Give us a chance
to learn, let us children have what our parents
never had, put books into our hands, train our
hands and eyes and ears and hearts as well as
our minds, show us how people who love that
Jesus whom you tell about may read of Him and
may make their lives good and happy and
useful!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is missionary
educational
work still
needed in the
awakening
East?</div>

<p>It may be the honest conviction of many that
with advancing civilization and the great political,
social, and educational awakening in many lands,
there is no further need for mission schools or for
pushing missionary educational work. Japan
has her public school system with six years of
compulsory school attendance, and higher courses
combining cultural with practical education in a
way that Western nations might well follow.
China has done away with the old educational
regime and is patterning her new system after
those of Christian lands. In India we hear that
“Mr. Gokhale’s bill for universal primary education
<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a id="Page_136"></a></span>
has stirred the whole country and will be
a constant issue until it is an accomplished fact.
Already the government has voted to increase
immediately the number of primary schools from
120,000 to 210,000.”<a id="Anchor-53" title="Go to Footnote 53" href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The demand for education
of girls as well as of boys in Persia, Turkey,
and Egypt has caused a marvelous overturning
and re-arranging of custom, prejudice, public
opinion, and government action. In view of all
this and much more in the same line, has the time
come when the matter of education can be left
in the hands of the awakening East, and does our
obligation to the little ones of non-Christian
lands cease at the door of the school room?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divergent
views on
education.</div>

<p>In order to arrive at a fair answer to these questions
it might be well to study and discuss some
divergent views on education and then to learn
how these questions are answered by those who
were born in non-Christian lands or who have
lived and worked there for many years.</p>

<p class="tb2">Some Views on Education</p>

<p>“To educate a girl is like putting a knife into
the hands of a monkey.” Hindu Proverb.</p>

<p>“The hope of our country is in the education of
our girls, and we shall never have statesmen
till the mothers are educated.” A Persian
Nobleman.</p>

<p>“Men are superior to women on account of the
<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a id="Page_137"></a></span>
qualities with which God has gifted the one
above the other.” The Koran, Sura 4.38.</p>

<p>“No scheme of education for primitive races
can succeed that neglects the woman’s influence
in the family and the tribe.” E. W. Coffin.<a id="Anchor-54" title="Go to Footnote 54" href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>“When a man does not ask, ‘What shall I
think of this and of that?’ I can do nothing with
him. Learning without thought is labor lost;
thought without learning is perilous.” Confucius
Quoted in “Oriental Religions,” Samuel Johnson.</p>

<p>“Education should lead and guide man to
clearness concerning himself and in himself, to
peace with nature and to unity with God.”
Froebel.</p>

<p>“The aim of female education is perfect submission,
not cultivation and development of the
mind.” Confucius.</p>

<p>“Not knowledge or information, but self-realization
is the goal. To possess all the world
of knowledge and lose one’s own self is as awful
a fate in education as in religion.” John
Dewey.</p>

<p>The Head Master of an English school declared
it to be his ideal of education to create an atmosphere
of loyalty that should teach the pupils
to adapt themselves to the sphere in which their
lives should be cast, at the same time giving them
self-reliance through the knowledge that they are
responsible for doing the things that are worth
<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a id="Page_138"></a></span>
while, and arousing their ambition to achieve
that which is highest and best.</p>

<p>As a practical basis for the study of our topic,
“The Child at School,” write out if you will
your own definition of the scope and ideals of
education, drawing up a list of those members
of the human family who would benefit by such
an education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons why
missionary
education
should be
continued.</div>

<p>Referring again to the question of whether
our missionary obligation ceases when the child’s
education begins, we must first of all realize
clearly how recent has been the awakening in
most of these lands, how appalling is the illiteracy,
how long it will take the most advanced government
to meet the need without assistance, and
how infinitely more a <em>Christian</em> education will
do for the little ones than a merely secular education
can possibly accomplish.</p>

Quoting further from the Cyclopedia we learn
that “in Turkey, India, and China we find a
high illiteracy among the males, and an almost
complete illiteracy among the females. The
least illiteracy today is to be found among the
people in the countries to the north and west of
Europe, and of Teutonic or mixed Teutonic
stock. It was in these countries that the Protestant
Revolt made its greatest headway and the
ability to read the Word of God and to participate
in the church services were regarded as of great
importance for salvation.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir J. D. Rees
on illiteracy in
Asia.</div>

<p>Sir J. D. Rees, an official of high position and
distinction in India, makes this significant statement
in his volume on “Modern India,” dated
1910&mdash;“While it is true that only half the boys of
school-going age were following a course of
primary education when the last census was
taken, it is extremely improbable that in any
other part of Asia anything approaching that
number has been ever attained, or in any Oriental
country under European control.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education in
Japan.</div>

<p>Let us go back to Japan as to the one of all non-Christian
lands that has made the greatest advance
along educational lines. After a visit
to Japan with many opportunities for observation
and study of the subject, Miss Kate G.
Lamson says:<a id="Anchor-56" title="Go to Footnote 56" href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Education for the masses has long since justified itself
to the Japanese. That education is universal and compulsory
<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a id="Page_140"></a></span>
is abundantly proved by the crowds of school
children seen in every part of the country. This naturally
leads the observer to question the need of outside help,
especially missionary help, along educational lines, and
outside of two or three large centres our Board has applied
itself largely to the development of church organization
and evangelistic work. Yet the experience of years has
revealed an imperative need of the missionary even in
the ranks of education in Japan....</p>

<p>With schools everywhere, under an able and full staff
of instructors, with up-to-date appliances for every branch
that is to be taught, moral and religious training are not
provided for, and the well-polished husk of educated
manhood and womanhood without the inner life is the
result. The dangers attending non-religious education
have not failed to make themselves apparent to the
watchful Japanese....</p>

<p>In every land we believe the hope of the nations lies
largely in the training of little children. Christianity in
Japan has laid hold upon this and has set the pace in the
establishing of kindergartens....</p>

<p>Although education in Japan is compulsory, it is a
fact that it is beyond the reach of the poorest people.
This anomalous situation is caused by the charges for
tuition and books imposed upon all scholars. These
charges are so high as to be prohibitive for the very poor,
and the result shows in the absence of their children from
school. In this lies a direct invitation for missionary
effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions of a
leading Japanese.</div>

<p>These words from a Christian observer and
student of missions find an echo in the remark
of a leading Japanese, himself a non-Christian,
to one of the team of workers of the Men and
Religion Movement:&mdash;“I am convinced that
Japan must become Christian or she will never
become a great nation.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Educational
awakening in
China.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="141"><a id="Page_141"></a></span>
So much is being said and published about the
wonderful developments in China and the new
system of education that is taking the place of
the old, time-honored memorizing of the “Four
Books” and the “Five Classics,” that we need
not here go into the subject in detail.

<span class="sidenote">Where shall
the teachers be
trained?</span>

But we
must stop to query:&mdash;Where is China to procure
the hundreds and thousands of teachers who are
needed to train not only the children at present
but the teachers of future generations of children?
For many long years she must look largely to
missionary schools to prepare her future educators.
From a report on the Educational Work of the
Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions we quote
the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wisdom of the West in matters of courses of study,
together with methods of teaching, discipline, etc., are
brought directly from our best institutions and freely
offered upon the altar of Chinese regeneration. The
results of these years have also proven that these best
things are adapted to the young Chinese minds, and that
they appreciate them when they once come to know them.
The products of these years show that our Christian
schools have been getting hold of some excellent material,
and that there is such true worth and high possibility
that all effort to develop these bright minds and sincere
hearts is well worth while, and that in doing so a great
service is rendered to China.... A number of young
women of fine type have been educated in the schools
for girls, who are proving themselves apt to teach and
work for their own people in the conduct of boarding and
day schools and women’s classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Indian grants
to mission
schools.</div>

<p>So highly does the Indian government prize
the work of the missionary schools that each
<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a id="Page_142"></a></span>
of them which is held to the required standard
of efficiency receives a grant for partial support.
The American Board Bulletin says, “Our tremendous
school system in Ceylon of more than
ten thousand pupils is carried on practically
at government expense.”</p>

<p>In a village in India the parents’ request for a
school was answered by the statement that if
such a school were opened, the Bible would be
taught in it. Quickly the reply came, “Teach
your religion, but educate our boys.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">New demand
for education in
Persia and
Turkey.</div>

<p>When the century opened, Persia and Turkey
were asleep. Suddenly came the awakening, the
reaching out for something new and different,
and, as in the case of China, one of the first
thoughts was,&mdash;Our children must be educated.
Instinctively they turned to the missionaries
who for long years had quietly, steadily, sown
the seed, prepared literature, set up printing
presses, trained preachers and teachers. Boys
<em>and girls</em> began to flock into the mission schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Messages from
Persian parents.</div>

<p>“Fathers sent pleasant messages,” wrote a
missionary in Teheran in 1911. “One said, ‘Your
girls make better wives and mothers and in every
way better women, than others.’ Another, ‘I
wish my wife had been educated, but I am determined
my daughter shall be.’ An Armenian of
wealth and influence is reported to have answered
to a remonstrance against sending his little
daughter to us instead of to their national
school: ‘Did I ever refuse to give you money?
<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a id="Page_143"></a></span>
I will continue to help support our national
schools, but I must send my daughters (he has
five) where they can really obtain an education.
They can learn in one week all you can teach
them about going to theatricals and dances.’
A friend was telling us that her sister would
send her girls to us. ‘Why?’ ‘Because every
Moslem in this city understands that your
school is the only one where girls really learn.
Why should my sister be the only fool?’”<a id="Anchor-57" title="Go to Footnote 57" href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">New schools
for girls in
Teheran.</div>

<p>These messages are significant in view of the
fact that in a brief time seventy girls’ schools
were reported to have sprung up suddenly in
Persia’s capital city, with an enrolment of five
thousand pupils.<a id="Anchor-58" title="Go to Footnote 58" href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But scarcely half a dozen
of those at the head of the schools had ever
been to school themselves, and the testimony
from all over Persia was the same as that at the
capital,&mdash;“The missionary schools are the best.”</p>

<p>Here is the eager call from Turkey:<a id="Anchor-59" title="Go to Footnote 59" href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote2">The call for
teachers in
Turkey.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The gradual awakening of the villages to the need of
better schools increases yearly the calls for teachers. The
Sivas Normal School reports that the work of the past
summer was very hard. “We were obliged to refuse
calls for more than forty teachers, not a few of them
from places to which we had never supplied teachers.
The following quotation from a letter from the Armenian
Bishop of one of our large cities is a fair sample: ‘We wish
to call for the Armenian schools of our city the following
<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a id="Page_144"></a></span>
teachers: a principal, a lady principal, teachers for
Armenian, Turkish, and French, and three teachers for
scientific branches. If you have among your experienced
teachers or among the new graduates persons to
recommend, please inform us at once in order that we
may invite them.’”</p>

author’s preface to his book, “Marriage and the
<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a id="Page_145"></a></span>

<blockquote>
<p>The author of this book comes from the ranks of those

of character-training, he has been led to realize for himself
the deep meaning and the profound pedagogical
wisdom of the Christian method of caring for souls, and
to appreciate, through his own experience, the value of
the old truths.... He has absolutely no doubt that modern
education, in discovering the extraordinary practical
difficulties of character-training, will be increasingly
cured of its optimistic illusions and led back to an understanding
and appreciation of Christianity.</p>

enjoy and appreciate school privileges offered
them by the missionaries, and does the work
show results that are worth while?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kindergarten
work in Japan.</div>

<p>If, as Miss Lamson claims, “the hope of the
nations lies in the training of little children,”
there is hope for Japan in the ninety-eight
mission kindergartens that are maintained by
fourteen Protestant Boards and have an enrollment
of four thousand and sixty-eight children.
The report of the Kindergarten Union of Japan
is a most fascinating volume, with its presentation
of opportunity, need, method, and the result
of teaching the tiny children who are to be the
future parents, teachers, and leaders of thought
and action in that Empire. A few extracts will
give a little idea of what is being done for the
children and through them for their homes and
friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">A Japanese

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="146"><a id="Page_146"></a></span>
The kindergarten in our country today is at its most
critical stage, and therefore needs the best and most
profound thinkers who can put their ideals into practice
most tactfully. This must be accomplished by native
Christian kindergartners. Education without religious
foundations is like an egg without the germ of life in it.
Most of our public and government kindergartens, which
have the purely so-called educational views of today, are
leaving the very springs of child life untouched, and
therefore are not fulfilling the real meaning of education.
They are not disciples of Froebel, because he based his
philosophy on the Christian faith. (Fuji Takamori of
Holy Love Kindergarten, Methodist.)</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote3">Results of
sending the
children to
kindergarten.</div>

<blockquote class="sn">
<p>A teacher writes, “A little girl whose father and mother
were Christians entered our school. At first a little
nursemaid brought her, then her grandmother came with
her. This grandmother was a devoted Buddhist. She
would not even look at the foreign teacher, much less
listen to anything being taught, but at last she began to
listen, and eventually became convinced that she needed
Christ for her Saviour. Today she is a truly converted
woman.”...</p>

<p>The blessing asked at the noon lunch seemed to make a
deep impression on some children, and doing it at home
attracts the parents’ attention, so that a number of them
have been known to come to the church services to hear
more about the meaning of prayer and praise. (Mrs. A. D.
Gordon.)</p>

<p>We are told that the songs, the games, the stories, and
sometimes the prayers, are household exercises in many
homes. On a recent morning, which we spent by invitation
of the wife of the Governor in her garden, the little
son of the family, not yet of kindergarten age, took an
active part with the other children. His mother told me
that the older sister comes home and “plays kindergarten”
with her small brother, and that, when they have guests
to entertain, the children are often called in to give some
<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a id="Page_147"></a></span>
kindergarten exercise. I did not tell her how strongly I
disapprove of “showing off” children before company.
I only prayed that “a little child might lead them.” (Mrs.
Genevieve F. Topping, of Morioka Kindergarten, Baptist.)</p>

<p>An amusing incident happened one day when the children
were off on an observation trip. They had to stop
to let a detachment of soldiers pass, and spontaneously
burst out singing “Soldier Boy, Soldier Boy,” to the
great amusement of the soldiers. Then they all saluted
the officer in proper fashion, but he only smiled. “Sensei,
we saluted politely, why didn’t he return the salute?”</p>

<p>Later as the soldiers were drawn up in circular formation
on the parade ground, the children said, “Oh, now
they are going to play just as we do in kindergarten,
let’s watch!” So the expedition which started out to
study insect life changed into a lesson on soldiers and
their absolute obedience to orders. (Alice Fyock of
Sendai Aoba Yochien, American Episcopal.)</p>

<p>After a hasty mental review of what has been
studied in earlier chapters regarding the home
life and training of little children in non-Christian
lands, it is surely a mild statement to make
that the Christian kindergarten is an <em>absolute
necessity</em> if these little ones, so cunning and
capable and helpless, are to have any chance at
all for proper development. The words “Christian
kindergarten” are used advisedly, and agree
with utterances of experts such as Elizabeth
Harrison, who says,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The foundation of the kindergarten is based
upon the psychological revelation that, if man
is the child of God, he must possess infinite
possibilities, and that these possibilities can only
develop as he, man, makes use of them&mdash;that in
other words, man is a self-making being, that his
likeness to the Divine Father consists in this
power within him to unfold and develop his
divine nature.”<a id="Anchor-61" title="Go to Footnote 61" href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Children of
backward races
respond to early
training.</div>

<p>Students of primitive and backward races tell
us that the small children show as much promise
and as many signs of undeveloped capability
as do children of civilized lands, but before many
years a cloud seems to overcast their minds,
<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a id="Page_149"></a></span>
while selfishness and sin and passion take possession
of their moral natures. Never again is
there the same chance to make them <em>what they
might have been</em>, as there was during those first
early days when the kindergarten should have
opened wide her doors to receive them. This
argument would in itself seem sufficient to urge
missionary Boards to speedy, thorough action
in this matter, but there is another far-reaching
argument to be considered. All through the
East, wherever there are missionary kindergartens,
mothers come to them to learn how to
train their children, and countless homes have
caught and passed on a reflection of the Christ
life because of what the mothers have heard and
observed and what the children have taken
home with them. Make a flying trip to the
Fuchow Kindergarten and watch “the irrepressible
John.”</p>

<p>“This little lad’s father died, after a period of
faithful service in Miss Wiley’s kitchen, and when
the widowed mother came back to Miss Wiley
from her country home to earn a living for herself
and John and baby Joseph, John was already
master of the situation and of his mother, and
enforced his will on that by no means weak-minded
woman by kicking, biting, pulling her
ears, and similar methods. Now Miss Wiley
is a famous trainer of boys, and she soon taught
the young mother that the masculine will is not
necessarily law at the age of two plus; the kindergarten
<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a id="Page_150"></a></span>
carried out the same idea, and now John
devotes vast energy and determination to the
shaping of inanimate clay into pigs and other
fascinating things, and treats animate nature as
a well-mannered and kindly little gentleman
should.”<a id="Anchor-62" title="Go to Footnote 62" href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kindergartners

<p>It would be most interesting and instructive
to make a tour of missionary kindergartens for
the purpose of seeing how ingenious our missionary
teachers are, how they adapt Froebel’s
ideas and methods to the most extraordinary
circumstances which would have made that
great educator gasp, how they must not only
translate and adapt songs and tunes and games,
but compose and create and invent,&mdash;all in an
acquired language which has perhaps been only recently
reduced to writing by some pioneer missionary.
It might be pertinent to ask if all Women’s
Boards provide the kindergartners and other
teachers whom they send to the foreign field with
a first-class outfit of all needed material, and if
they remember that such an outfit needs to be
replenished at least as often as a similar one
does in the home land. It is not fair to require
a missionary to make bricks without straw.</p>

<p>We have a new primary Sunday-School room which will
be my kindergarten. It is a low wall covered by a round
<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a id="Page_151"></a></span>
thatched roof high enough to leave a good big space for
air. The floor is mudded and marked in squares. It
looks very nice, but I shall take pains to get the cracks
filled up, for they catch too much dirt and jigger seeds.
The benches are not yet made, so the children who were
cleaned up for Sunday went after leaves to sit on. The
classes have to go out under trees to separate, but it is
a great improvement upon the dirty and dangerous saw
pit where they have met for so long. The only advantage
about the saw pit was the roof for shade and pieces of
wood and logs to sit upon. The big folks have been
getting most of the attention and all of the advantages,
but we feel that the children should have most because
they are in the future. They do not show such shining
results at once, but work with them will lay a foundation
which is greatly needed here for really effective work....</p>

<p>I have a box cupboard, a sand table, two long low
tables marked with squares, and strong benches. I have
not much kindergarten material, but I do not need more
at present. My first “gift” is a basin of water. They
march in singing “Good morning, kind teacher” (only
I am thankful to say the Umbundu words leave out the
“kind”). Then we sing another song or two, and the
prayer with bowed heads. I have no music, so I have
to learn the tunes myself before I come to school. The
children are the dearest, cunning things and they do want
to learn.<a id="Anchor-63" title="Go to Footnote 63" href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive education
among
backward nations.</div>

<p>There are lands such as large sections of Africa
and many of the Pacific Islands where no education
whatever existed, where the language was
not even reduced to writing, until Christian
missionaries began their work. Other countries
gave a certain so-called education to their boys
or to the sons of certain privileged classes, leaving
<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a id="Page_152"></a></span>
the girls absolutely illiterate. They agreed
in principle if not in expression with that man in
the mountains of Kurdistan who was asked by
a missionary to send his bright little daughter
down to the mission school at the beginning of the
fall term. “Do you want my girl?” questioned
the man in amazement and disgust. “Why don’t
you take my cow?”</p>

<p>Again in other sections girls have a brief
chance to learn, but are not expected to keep
pace with their brothers or to attain to anything
beyond the rudiments of book learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lack of concentration.</div>

<p>A missionary educator from Turkey says that
one of the greatest difficulties in school work
arises from the fact that the children have no
power of concentration, no idea of how to think
and study on one line for any length of time.
It often takes five or six years for a child really
to learn how to study. Obviously, the earlier
these preparatory years occur in a child’s life,
the more benefit may he hope to derive from his
education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils of the
memorizing
method.</div>

<p>Then again, if children learn their first
lessons in the native schools of Turkey, Persia,
Korea, and various other countries, they will
become fixed in the habit of memorizing without
giving any intelligent thought to what they
learn. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> S. M. Zwemer says:</p>

<p>“A Moslem lad is not supposed to know what
the words and sentences mean which he must
recite every day; to ask a question regarding the
<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a id="Page_153"></a></span>
<em>thought</em> of the Koran would only result in a
rebuke or something more painful. Even grammar,
logic, history, and theology are taught by
rote in the higher Mohammedan schools....
Thousands of Moslem lads, who know the whole
Koran nearly by heart, cannot explain the
meaning of the first chapter in every-day language.
Tens of thousands can ‘read’ the
Koran at random in the Moslem sense of reading,
who cannot read an Arabic newspaper intelligently.”<a id="Anchor-64" title="Go to Footnote 64" href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>How utterly this differs from the theory and
practice of <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Montessori, who “calls a child
disciplined who is master of himself, and therefore
able to dispose of or control himself whenever
he needs to follow a rule of life. The liberty
of the child must have as its limit only the collective
interest. To interfere with this spontaneity
is, in <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Montessori’s view, perhaps to
repress the very essential of life itself.”<a id="Anchor-65" title="Go to Footnote 65" href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> How
can a child be master of himself who is not even
allowed to inquire into the meaning of what he
reads and studies?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Old methods
hard to discard.</div>

<p>It is not always easy for the missionary suddenly
to introduce changes of method and practice,
and many a missionary school which is infinitely
superior to the native institution might shock
an American school superintendent beyond recovery.
<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a id="Page_154"></a></span>
A missionary from China wrote,&mdash;“I
found I must still keep many old methods or
the Chinese would not send their children. I
have found it necessary to let them <em>learn</em> portions
of Scripture and classics and shout them at the
tops of their voices, then gradually work in music,
geography, and arithmetic.” Another argument
for beginning as early as possible with the children
who can so easily adapt themselves to ideas of a
quiet, orderly school if they have never enjoyed
exercising their lungs in one of the other kind!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education of
girls in Persia.</div>

<p>In speaking of primitive education among
backward nations, mention was made of the scant
attention given to girls as compared to boys.
The London Times not long ago stated in commenting
on the women of Persia, “As a matter
of fact, probably not one girl in a thousand
twenty years ago ever received any education.
When the parents were rich enough, tuition of a
sort was given at home, but in the case of poorer
persons it was enough if their sons were taught
to read and write.”</p>

<p>In contrast we learn that in the spring of 1913
about one thousand children from Moslem homes
were in attendance at Protestant missionary
schools in Persia, over two hundred of them
being girls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early marriage
a barrier to
education.</div>

<p>In Mohammedan and other lands the custom
of early marriage is an almost insuperable barrier
to an adequate education for a girl. That this
custom <em>must</em> be changed, if men are to have
<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a id="Page_155"></a></span>
worthy wives and if children are to be properly
trained, is a truth that is beginning to be realized.
The recent great awakening and desire for education
is creating a marvelous change in age-long
customs.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Lord Cromer on
conditions in
Egypt.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Lord Cromer says: “The position of women in Egypt,
and in Mohammedan countries generally, is a fatal obstacle
to the attainment of that elevation of thought and character
which should accompany the introduction of European
civilization, if that civilization is to produce its full
measure of beneficial effect. The obvious remedy would
appear to be to educate the women.... When the first
efforts to promote female education were made, they met
with little sympathy from the population in general.... Most
of the upper-class Egyptians were not merely indifferent
to female education; they were absolutely opposed to
it....</p>

<p>“All this has now been changed. The reluctance of
parents to send their daughters to school has been largely
overcome.... The younger generation are beginning to
demand that their wives shall possess some qualifications
other than those which can be secured in the seclusion of
the harem.”</p>

<p>In 1912 Lord Kitchener states that “There is probably
nothing more remarkable in the social history of Egypt
during the last dozen years than the growth of public
opinion among all classes of Egyptians in favor of the education
of their daughters. The girls’ schools belonging
to the Ministry of Education are crowded, and to meet
the growing demand sites have been acquired and fresh
schools are to be constructed, one at Alexandria and two
in Cairo. Very many applications have, however, to be
refused.”<a id="Anchor-66" title="Go to Footnote 66" href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

To these quotations <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Sailer adds the significant
words,&mdash;“The missionary schools for girls

The government officials were prompt in acknowledging
that missionary teachers brought
to their work a spirit which money could not
buy.”</p>

<p>Scant justice can be done in these few pages
to the whole vast subject of the education of
girls in the East, and the rapid changes that are
taking place in regard to it. A careful study of
the subject will well repay the thoughtful woman.

<span class="sidenote">Now is the
time to educate
the future
mothers.</span>

As all roads lead to Rome, so all reading and
observation along this line will lead the candid
student to one conclusion:&mdash;<em>Now is the time to
determine the character of the mothers of the next
generation of children in non-Christian lands.</em>
What those little bright-eyed baby girls of
Africa and India, Turkey and Korea are to be
and do, what their homes are to be like, what
start in life their children are to have, will be
largely determined by what we Christian women
do or fail to do for them today. If it is too late
to do much for their mothers before these children
have left their homes, why not gather the children
into kindergartens and primary schools, why not
teach the little ones <em>now</em> while their minds are
plastic and impressionable? Why not do our
share toward bringing Christian civilization into
darkened lands by educating in Christian schools
today the mothers of tomorrow?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teaching children
to play.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="157"><a id="Page_157"></a></span>
In the preceding chapter great emphasis was
laid on the necessity for teaching the children of
many mission lands how to play, not only for
the benefit of their health and to bring joy and
brightness into their lives, but also in order to
teach them what “fair play” and co-operation
mean. It is the missionary school, from kindergarten
up to university, that gives the golden
opportunity for this teaching, as is shown by the
testimony of a missionary from Tientsin, China:&mdash;“We
believe that such games teach them to be
honest in business dealings later, to be truthful,
unselfish, quick-witted, and self-controlled. The
change which I have seen in these little, un-taught,
ill-cared-for children after five years in the mission
school is due in part, I believe, to the lessons
of ‘fair play’ learned in their games.”</p>

<p>But the school must go even further than this
and include in its curriculum physical education
of a very definite kind if it is to meet <em>all</em> the needs
of the children it is serving. Taking as an
example of all mission lands, China, whose system
of education antedates by many centuries all
our western civilization, let us observe through
the eyes of the former physical director of the
Shanghai <abbr title="Young Men’s Christian Association">Y. M. C. A.</abbr> what the real situation is.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Physical
training.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Physical training should be dignified by giving it an
equal place with the sciences, philosophies, and languages
in the curriculum, and the same careful provision of means
and trained men to direct it. No educational system is
adequate which does not aim at the whole man, which
<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a id="Page_158"></a></span>
does not recognize the physical basis of intellectual and
spiritual efficiency. Professor Tyler of Amherst says,
“Brain and muscle are never divorced in the action of
healthy higher animals and in healthy men. They should
not be divorced in the education of the child.”...</p>

<p>It is clear that physical training, in the largest sense,
must play an important part in the making of the “New
China.” The questions involved in her uplift are most
largely physical questions. The personal, domestic, and
public observance of the laws of health and life is a
physical question; the combating of that terrible scourge,
tuberculosis, is a physical question; the checking of the
fearful infant mortality is a physical question; etc....</p>

<p>The progress which has been made in physical training
in China must be viewed in the light of the fact that
physical exercise for its own sake has had no part in the
national life of China for centuries. It has been considered
improper for a Chinese gentleman to indulge in it.
The popular conception of a Chinese scholar has been
that of a man with a great head, emaciated body, and
hollow chest, sitting and contemplating the problem of
life by thinking dissociated from doing. Until ten
years ago athletics were almost unknown. When foreigners
were seen playing football the Chinese were greatly
puzzled, and wanted to know how much these men were
being paid for cutting up such foolish antics, conceiving
it as out of the question that any one would work so hard
without being well paid for it. All that is rapidly being
changed. Physical training is changing China’s conception
of a gentleman. The ideal of all-round manhood,
well-balanced in its physical, mental, and spiritual aspects,
is rapidly gaining ground.<a id="Anchor-67" title="Go to Footnote 67" href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could all China’s children today be taught
this ideal, the task would be far easier than it
will be when they have reached adult life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“The athletic
method in
Kashmir.”</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="159"><a id="Page_159"></a></span>
The story of the Missionary School for Boys in
Srinagar, Kashmir, is as thrilling as a novel,
and illustrates to a remarkable degree how body,
mind, and soul must be trained and disciplined
and developed in order to realize the ideal of the
Principal, the <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> C. E. Tyndale-Biscoe, who
says, “We are making citizens, of what sort remains
to be seen. But we hope without wavering
that these citizens will be Christian citizens,
for Christ is our ideal.” Some of the difficulties
are thus described:</p>

<p>“To teach the three R’s in Kashmir is easy work.
The boys are willing to squat over their books and
grind away for as many hours a day as nature
makes possible. To get an education means
sedentary employment <i xml:lang="la">cum</i> rupees. And that
to the Kashmiri is living.</p>

<p>“But to <em>educate</em> is a very different matter. To
make men of a thousand or more boys who care
nothing for manliness; among whose ancestors
for hundreds of years, chicanery, deceit, and
cruelty had been the recognized and honored paths
to success, while generosity and honesty had been
the mark of a fool; to try to quicken and develop
the good in such boys,&mdash;boys coming from impure
homes, squatting in unclean rows, with bent backs
and open mouths&mdash;was flatly pronounced folly
by many a visitor to Kashmir.”<a id="Anchor-68" title="Go to Footnote 68" href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The story tells how boxing, swimming, rowing,
<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a id="Page_160"></a></span>
and gymnastics are required of the students as a
most necessary and vital part of their education,
and how they are trained to be proud of using
these accomplishments in helping others. By
the time a Brahmin boy,&mdash;they are almost all
Brahmins in this school,&mdash;has saved a child from
drowning, rescued a family of despised sweepers
from the roof of their flood-swept house, delivered
a poor woman from being beaten, and helped
clean up the streets and alleys of a city during a
cholera epidemic, he has received an education
such as no books in the world can give him, and
Kashmir is one step nearer to the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Building a
“great personality.”</div>

<p>“Train not thy child,” says Emerson, “so that
at the age of thirty or forty he shall have to say,
‘This great work could I have done but for the
lack of a body.’” Elizabeth Harrison, after
quoting Emerson, adds, “Is not this carelessness
as to health one of the ways in which we are not
conserving the forces that make for righteousness
and truth, one of the ways in which we are neglecting
to build up ‘a great personality’ in our
children?”<a id="Anchor-69" title="Go to Footnote 69" href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Up to this point our study of The Child in non-Christian
lands has shown that the missionary
must touch the home life, the customs and ideals
handed down from remote ancestors, the play and
work and education and physical development
<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a id="Page_161"></a></span>
of the child, in order to give him his inalienable
rights, while in the next chapter we shall dwell on
his right to know of Jesus Christ, the children’s
Friend. It may seem to the reader (as it does
to the writer) that the chapters overlap one
another in spite of the heroic effort to treat each
subject by itself. But most of us find,&mdash;do we
not?&mdash;that it is a bit difficult to attend to the
spiritual culture of our boys when they are
clamoring to go out and play ball, or to get our
little girls to tell what they learned at school,
when they are hungry for their dinner. The
mother must train <em>all parts</em> of her child’s nature
by attending to the need that is uppermost at
the time,&mdash;the missionary must do the same for
her foster children, and the woman at home,
behind the missionary, has to recognize the same
inseparable inter-relation of body, mind, and soul
in the little ones of whom she is studying. Our
divisions into “subjects” must be more or less
artificial. However, to this particular subject
of “The Child at School” belong naturally two
more matters which must be touched on briefly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The need for
good literature.</div>

<p>When the Turkish girl has learned to read, when
six thousand boys have annually been trained
in that great chain of Anglo-Chinese schools
started by the Methodists in Malaysia, when
Korean children have acquired a taste for reading
and study, where are they to find suitable, interesting
books? The Cyclopedia of Education
pays a wonderful tribute to what <em>one</em> Book has
<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a id="Page_162"></a></span>
done for Korea, saying that “the translation of
the Bible into Korean and its rapid distribution,
and revivals marked with habitual study of the
Bible, compelled many to learn the alphabet to
master a sacred library so rich, and has constituted
a national school of intelligence and
culture.” But other books than the Bible must
be translated and written in order to give clean,
interesting, wholesome literature to the children
of countless thousands who never had any use for
a literature for themselves. As Miss Lilian
Trotter of Algiers says,&mdash;“Those who have been
patiently toiling over the schooling of Moslem
girls and women begin to feel that the powers
of reading gained in school days should be used as
a means to an end, not left to lapse in the first
years that ensue for want of following up. Letters
from the whole reach of the Moslem world give the
same refrain,&mdash;the girls drop their reading largely
because there is nothing published that interests
them. The few upper class women who read,
read little but newspapers and French novels.
Could not some one who understands child minds
work out bright beginnings for the use of their
waking powers in stories and pictures with
colored lettering and borders? Easterns <em>must</em>
have color to make them happy!”<a id="Anchor-70" title="Go to Footnote 70" href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Here is a call to missionary work for some one
who never dreamt that her particular literary
<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a id="Page_163"></a></span>
and artistic talents are absolutely needed today
by the children of the East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Industrial
training in
mission
schools.</div>

<p>The second matter mentioned above is the
need for industrial training. Great progress
has been made in this respect in recent years, but
much more progress is needed, and trained teachers
and suitable equipment are required. As a
missionary in Persia says when urging that more
industrial training be given the school girls,&mdash;“A
woman may be able to read, but, if unable
to bake or prepare a good meal, her husband
will not care if she reads about the Bread of
Life. She may play the organ, but, if she cannot
wash, mend, make the children’s clothes, and
make a happy home, he will have little interest
in hearing her play or sing ‘The Home over
there.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of
American
missionary
education.</div>

<p>There is abundant testimony to prove that
America is already doing great things in the line
of missionary education. Here is the testimony
of a traveler and newspaper man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of mission schools and colleges supported
by Americans with American money is nearly as large as
that of all the schools conducted by the missionaries of
all other countries combined. We have approximately
10,000 schools in lands that are not under our flag and
from which we receive not a cent of revenue.</p>

<p>If a man in quest of material for an American educational
exhibit were to sail out of San Francisco Bay with
a phonograph recorder, he would come up on the other
side of Sandy Hook with a polyglot collection of records
that would give the people of the United States a new conception
of their part in the world’s advance toward light.
<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a id="Page_164"></a></span>
His audience might hear a spelling class recite in the
tuneful Hawaiian tongue or listen to Moros, Tagalogs,
and Igorrotes reading from the same “McGuffey’s
Reader.” A change of records might bring the sound of little
Japanese reciting geography, or of Chinese repeating the
multiplication table in a dozen dialects. Another record
would tell in quaint Siamese the difference between a
transitive or an intransitive verb, or conjugate the verb
“to be” in any one of the languages of India. One might
hear a professor from Pennsylvania lecturing on anatomy
to a class of young men in the ancient kingdom of Darius;
or a young woman from Massachusetts explaining the
mysteries of an eclipse to a group of girls in Constantinople;
or a Princeton man telling in Arabic the relation
between a major and a minor premise. And when the
audience had listened to all this and to “My country, ’tis
of thee” in Eskimo and in Spanish, the exhibit of American
teaching would have only begun.<a id="Anchor-71" title="Go to Footnote 71" href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Languages
used.</div>

<p>One American Mission Board alone (the
Presbyterian) uses the following languages and
dialects in its educational institutions:&mdash;Arabic,
Armenian, Beng, Bulu, English, Fang, French,
German, Hainanese, Hakka, Hindi, Italian,
Japanese, Korean, Laos, Mandarin (and many
dialects in our eight China missions; the dialects
of China are as diverse as the languages of
Europe), Marathi, Mpongwe, Persian, Portuguese,
Punjabi, Sanscrit, Siamese, Spanish, Syriac,
Tagalog, Turkish, Urdu, Visayan.<a id="Anchor-72" title="Go to Footnote 72" href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Where shall we
put the emphasis?</div>

<p>But in spite of all that is being done, we continue
to make our plea for the <em>little children</em>.
Whatever emphasis may be laid on the need for
<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a id="Page_165"></a></span>
boarding schools, colleges, normal, and industrial
training schools, let us remember that those
who are taught while small will make the most
hopeful students in these more advanced schools,
and the best workers in the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How missionary
schools lead
children to
Christ.</div>

<p>How quickly and easily and naturally the little
ones learn of Jesus, the children’s Friend, and
their relation to Him, we have already seen
illustrated in the kindergarten work of Japan.
A little six-year-old Greek boy in Syria, who
had attended the missionary kindergarten, spent
the summer in the mountains and became dreadfully
wild and profane. On his return to school
the teacher asked why he had been so naughty.
He replied, “I didn’t pray during the summer.
Now I’m going to pray and be a good boy.”</p>

<p>To Mrs. Pitcher of Amoy we owe the following
<span class="nowrap">incident:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A scholar in one of our schools, whose relatives were all
idol worshippers and very ignorant, was led to give her
heart to Jesus, and became a most active little Christian;
but one day she was taken very ill with plague, and during
her last hours she was so happy singing hymns she had
learned at school and telling her parents and old grandmother
about the Home beyond, where she would soon
be with the Lord, that all that heathen family were led
by this dying child to believe in a God of love, who could
so comfort His little child, and save her from the terror
and dread of the many evil spirits in whom they had
blindly trusted.<a id="Anchor-73" title="Go to Footnote 73" href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Mission school
children in
after-life.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="166"><a id="Page_166"></a></span>
This chapter cannot end before we follow into
their later life some of the children whose early
and perhaps whose only education was received
in missionary schools.</p>

<p>“The home in Syria whose mother was taught
in a school can always be distinguished at a
glance, whether it belongs to the Protestant
community or to one of the old Christian sects.
Neatness and good taste prevail, the children
are more carefully trained, the members of the
family work for each other’s benefit. One of
our school girls, who was married to an uneducated
man, told us years after: ‘Letter by letter
I taught him to read, figure by figure I taught
him arithmetic, and then I drew him down upon
his knees and word by word I taught him to
pray.’”<a id="Anchor-74" title="Go to Footnote 74" href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Boys of West
Africa.</div>

<p>From the <cite>Spirit of Missions</cite> we quote the
following about the boys at Cape Mount, West
<span class="nowrap">Africa:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“These people can be reached by Christianity
best in their childhood, before superstitions, belief
in the Gregre, or the influence of the life of a
Mohammedan has become grafted into their
lives. If allowed to grow up in their native
villages they often become leaders of tribal wars,
and, unknowingly, men of the vilest character.
In one tribe from which several boys are at the
mission, the mother tattoos curious marks on the
forehead of her babe, in order that if during war
<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a id="Page_167"></a></span>
he is captured and in after years she becomes able
to redeem him from slavery, she may be able to
recognize her own child. With the influence and
training of a Christian mission, even though
the boys go back to native life, they do not go
back to all of its vileness, and one can soon distinguish
between them and the un-Christianized
heathen.”</p>

<p>It takes faith and hope and love and a vision
far into the future to teach boys like these. But
it pays, and the “bread cast on the waters” is
often found again in most unlikely places, such as
those described in a letter from Mr. W. C.
Johnson of West <span class="nowrap">Africa:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Everywhere I find in the village schools sources
of Christian influence. In one village where I
stayed all night, all of the boys and all but two
of the women were Christians. This was entirely
the work of Christian school boys. In another
place a young man told me that there were only
two young men in the community who were not
trying to lead Christian lives. This too was the
work of the Christian school boys.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A few months
at school and
what they accomplished.</div>

<p>A little Mohammedan girl attended for a very
few months the mission day school in a near-by
city street. Her cruel step-mother persecuted
her bitterly, throwing her school books on the
floor and trampling them under foot to show her
contempt of Christian learning. Some kind
friend at the school gave the child forty cents,&mdash;unheard-of
wealth to the little one,&mdash;and the
<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a id="Page_168"></a></span>
missionary suggested that a teacher should
help the child spend it for something she greatly
needed before the mother could take it away.
“No,” said the little girl, “I don’t want to spend
it in that way. I want to give it all to the Lord
and then I shall have treasure in heaven. I
learned that at school.” She was married,&mdash;without
any choice in the matter,&mdash;to a man
who had known Christians and was favorable to
them, and the little wife lived a consistent Christian
life and died trusting in Christ as her Saviour.</p>

<p>Only a few months at school for a few hours of
each day, but they made all the difference for
time and for eternity! How many children are
having such an opportunity because of us and
our missionary society? How many are deprived
of the opportunity because it is “not our business”
to help them realize the truth of what was
said in days of old,&mdash;“Wisdom is the principal
thing, therefore get wisdom. The fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”</p>

<h3>QUOTATIONS</h3>

<h4>EDUCATIONAL WORK IN SIAM</h4>

<p>American missionaries were the pioneers in true educational
work in Siam. They gave to Siam its first real
school. They aided Siam in establishing the Government
Educational system, and encouraged the Department of
Education to establish normal training schools. They
introduced the printing press into Siam, made the first
Siamese type, and taught Siam the art of printing.</p>

<p>American missionaries gave Siam its first newspaper in
<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a id="Page_169"></a></span>
the Siamese language, and gave the first Geography,
Astronomy, Anatomy, and Physiology, Chemistry, Arithmetic,
and Geometry in the Siamese language.</p>

<p>When the King of Siam made the first move for the
establishment of a school system over Siam, he placed an
American missionary at the head of the work. The
present Minister of Education was at one time pupil of
a missionary, later on he became fellow student of one
of the missionaries in Sanscrit, and still consults the
missionaries on educational questions and literary subjects.</p>

<p>In the past twenty-five years the Presbyterian Mission
at Siam has received more money from the Siamese king,
princes, nobles, and common people for the maintenance
of educational work, than it has received from the Presbyterian
Church in America. (Educational Work of the <abbr title="Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church">Bd.
For. Miss. of the Pres. Ch.</abbr>)</p>

<h4>PERSIAN SCHOOLS</h4>

<p>An English boy learns to read his own language first,
and does not always go on to a foreign language. A
Persian boy learns to read a foreign language first, and
does not always go on to his own language. When a
little Persian boy goes to school he is given a big Arabic
book, with a great many long words in it, and he is not
taught how the words are spelt, but is told what they are,
and made to repeat them from memory, pointing to each
word in the book as he says it, and gradually he gets some
idea of which word is which.... The Mohammedans
think that reading the Koran, quite apart from understanding
it, is a very good action, so the little Persian
boys work away at it, and they do not think it hard
lines because all men and big boys began in the same way,
so it seems the natural thing to do. And perhaps it is
a little consolation to know that when they reach certain
points they will be given sweets. One little boy who was
asked how far he had got in the Koran, said that he had
just got his first sweets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="170"><a id="Page_170"></a></span>
Having finished the Koran, our little Persian boy goes
on to Persian books. These, too, he studies in much the
same way as he did the Koran, but it is more useful,
because now he understands what he reads. After plodding
through the Koran it is a pleasant change for little
Ghulam Husain to turn to the “War between the Cats
and Mice” or the “Hundred Fables.” Later on he reads
the poems of Hafiz and Sa’adi, and other great Persian
poets.</p>

<p>The Persians do not apparently think much of their
own system of education, for they are always laughing
at their schoolmasters. They have a story of a charvadar,
or muleteer, one of whose mules strayed one day into a
school. It was quickly driven out, and the muleteer
claimed damages to the extent of half the value of a
mule. The schoolmaster indignantly asked on what he
based his claim. The muleteer turned to the crowd which
had gathered to listen to the argument. “My beast,”
said he, “went into his school a mule and it has come out
a donkey.” You see, a donkey counts half a mule in
caravan traveling, just as child counts half a person in
train traveling.</p>

<p>When a boy is caned in punishment he lies on his back
and holds out his feet instead of his hands. Sometimes
his feet are held in a kind of stocks while he is caned across
the soles. They call it “eating sticks” or “eating wood.”
(Mrs. Napier Malcolm in “Children of Persia.”)</p>

<h4>EDUCATION, BULU TRIBE, AFRICA</h4>

<p>There is no more extraordinary feature of the work
among the Bulu than the readiness with which this little
forest creature submits himself to the discipline of school.
From a heritage of liberty he comes to knock at the
Mission door and to set his little jiggered feet upon the
new way of order. He who came and went at will keeps
the commandments of the school drum. He who has
been bred to inter-tribal hatred eats out of the pot with
<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a id="Page_171"></a></span>
his hereditary enemy. He earns his food in all honor under
the Mission law of labor. He permits himself to be
“tied” with “ten tyings” to a standard of conduct which
is the reverse of his racial standards.</p>

<p>In the rude school house, with his alphabet before him,
or in the open, cutlass in hand, he performs daily acts
of order and discipline, and these little tasks are regenerative.
His little sister is beside him and subjected to
the same process. The presence of the Mission in a
Bulu community is a great blessing to a little girl. It is
a kind of sanctuary and a police patrol. I cannot think
that you would like to know from what perils it saves
her.... Such little girls, following in the paths after their
brothers, have come to own a slate, to own a primer, to
ply a needle, to sleep at night in peace under a Christian
thatch and in innocent company. (“Other Children”
by Jean Mackenzie, <abbr title="Women’s Foreign Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church">Wom. For. Miss. Soc. Pres.</abbr>)</p>

<h4>A GIRLS’ SCHOOL IN THE KURDISH
MOUNTAINS</h4>

<p>Ever since coming here I have talked to both men and
women, as occasion offered, about the folly of not allowing
girls to learn anything. When I felt pretty sure of
two little girls, I announced one Sunday to the women
who were gathered in my room that on Thursday I should
begin a girls’ school for any who cared to come. What
was my surprise and delight on Thursday to have one of
the Kashas (Old Church pastors) come bringing, not two
but <em>four</em> little girls who promptly walked up to me and
kissed my hand. The next day another, who had not
heard of the school the first day, came. After three days
one girl disappeared. On Saturday I visited her home
and found they were keeping her to work, and this,
according to my idea of the circumstances, seemed very
unnecessary, for I keep them only two hours a day at
present. When I expostulated with the father, he said,
“Why should I take the trouble to let her go to school,
<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a id="Page_172"></a></span>
when after a little time I’ll marry her into some other
family?” Here girls are married very young, at twelve
years, many of them. All I could say was of no avail.
During all this conversation poor Rachel sat between
us, the tears running down her face, and saying repeatedly,
“Father, let me go.” The father was too selfish to be
moved by her pleadings. (Letter from Mrs. E. W.
McDowell.)</p>


<h3>BIBLE READING<br/>

TEACHING THE CHILDREN</h3>


<p class="mem"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 11:18&ndash;21 with <abbr title="second  to Timothy">2d Tim.</abbr> 1:5 and 3:14&ndash;17.</p>


<p>The natural, constant teaching of God’s commandments
in the daily life of the home by parents and grandparents
will prepare the children to lead prosperous, successful,
useful lives. What is learned in childhood “furnishes”
the man or woman for life.</p>

<p>“Therefore if to the goodness of nature be joined the
wisdom of the teacher in leading young wits into a right
and plain way of learning, surely children, kept up in
God’s fear, and governed by His grace, may most easily
be brought well to serve God and country both by virtue
and wisdom.” (Roger Ascham in the year 1570.)</p>


<h3>PRAYER</h3>

<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, Thou Child of Bethlehem, bless,
we beseech Thee, the children gathered in Christian
schools; may they be truthful, pure, obedient, and ever
ready to do their duty in that state of life to which Thou
shalt be pleased to call them, Who livest and reignest with
the Father and Holy Ghost, one God, world without end.
Amen.</p>


<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1. Give five reasons for multiplying kindergartens and
primary schools in non-Christian lands.</p>

<p>2. In the missionary Forward Movement in China,
should the emphasis in advance educational work be
put on primary or on secondary education?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="173"><a id="Page_173"></a></span>
3. Give the reasons for and against an increase in
Missionary educational work in Japan. What is your
personal opinion on the subject?</p>

<p>4. Should the missionary teacher aim to secure a large
number of scholars, or to give more time and personal
attention to a few? Give your reasons for your answer.</p>

<p>5. If you were facing a school of fifty little children
who had absolutely no idea of education, cleanliness,
manners, morals, or Christianity, what would you try
to teach them during the first week? How would you
go about it? (This takes it for granted that you know
their language.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="179"><a id="Page_179"></a></span>
What wonderful pictures flash before the mind
as one repeats the words, “The Child at Worship”!
The picture, familiar to childhood, of the boy
Samuel, kneeling in the temple with folded hands
and uplifted eyes; the picture on the nursery
wall of vested choir boys or earnest-faced children
singing praises in the sanctuary; the bowed
heads of little ones in the primary room at Sunday-School,
while with hushed voices they sing
their prayer song; the hour far back in childhood
when you knelt at your mother’s knee; or the
sweet moment when your sleepy baby cuddled
in your arms and learned to lisp, “Now I lay
me.” All that is sweetest, purest, holiest in
childhood seems to find full expression and
highest reality as we see the child at worship,
for “except ye turn and become as little children,
ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of
heaven, ... for their angels do always behold
the face of my Father which is in heaven.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Child at
Worship in
Thibet.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="180"><a id="Page_180"></a></span>
The Child at Worship! Far off in distant
Thibet today thousands of children are praying
morning, noon, and night, joining their parents
in the constant repetition of one six-syllabled
sentence, “Om mani padme Hum” (“Om! the
Jewel in the Lotus! Hum”!) This prayer they
are taught from earliest childhood to use as “a
panacea for all evils, a compendium of all knowledge,
a treasury of all wisdom, a summary of
all religion.” It is engraved on the outside of
metal cylinders, written on rolls within rolls of
paper inserted into the cylinders, which are held
in the right hand and whirled round and round
like a child’s toy,&mdash;each revolution storing up
merit to the worshipper. But alack! if the
careless boy whirls the prayer cylinder in the
wrong direction, i.e., not with the sun, he is adding
to the debit side of his account, and the more
zealously he “prays,” the less good will his prayers
do him.<a id="Anchor-75" title="Go to Footnote 75" href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> “They think they shall be heard
for their much speaking.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Child at
Worship in
India.</div>

<p>The Child at Worship in India! “All the way
up the bank they are killing and skinning their
goats. You look to the right and put your hands
over your eyes. You look to the left, and do it
again. You look straight in front of you and
see an extended skinned victim hung from the
branch of a tree. Every hanging rootlet of the
great banyan-tree is hung with horrors,&mdash;all
dead most mercifully, but horribly still....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="181"><a id="Page_181"></a></span>
“We see little children watching the process
delightedly. There is no intentional cruelty,
for the god will not accept the sacrifice unless
the head is severed by a single stroke. But it is
most disgusting and demoralizing. And to think
that these children are being taught to connect
it with religion!</p>

<p>“With me is one who used to enjoy it all. She
tells me how she twisted the fowls’ heads off with
her own hands. I look at the fine little brown
hands, and I can hardly believe it. ‘You, <em>you</em>,
do such a thing!’ And she says, ‘Yes; when the
day came round to sacrifice to our family divinity
my little brother held the goat’s head while my
father struck it off, and I twisted the chickens’
heads. It was my pleasure.’”<a id="Anchor-76" title="Go to Footnote 76" href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Truly, “the dark places of the earth are full
of the habitations of cruelty!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mohammedan
Child
at Worship.</div>

<p>The Mohammedan Child at Worship! From
the minaret of the Sunni Mosque or the roof of
the Shi’ite Mosque sounds the call to prayer.
Children of seven or older are supposed to join
their elders in obeying the summons five times
a day,&mdash;in the early dawn, at noon, two hours
before sunset, at sunset, and two hours later.
The religious law, however, provides that no
child shall be beaten for neglecting his prayer
until he is ten years of age.</p>

<p>Praying, however, is not as easy a task for the
Mohammedan lad as for his Thibetan cousin.
<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a id="Page_182"></a></span>
He must first wash his face, hands, and arms,
feet, and legs, learning which side of the face,
which hand and foot to wash first, whether the
arms should be stroked from the wrist to the
elbow or in the opposite direction. His prayer
will not count before the great “Allah” if the
ablutions are not correct. Then he must learn
the words of the prayers, and these are in Arabic,
which three-fourths of the Mohammedan children
of the world cannot understand. Turning toward
Mecca, he must stand, kneel, and bow himself
with his forehead to the ground, at just the
proper intervals during the prayer. At the age
of twelve he begins to observe the month of
Ramazan, and his nine-year-old sister must do
the same, when from sunrise to sunset no morsel
of food or drop of drink may cross their lips.
“Is such the fast that I have chosen? wilt thou

Jehovah?” With deep insight into the truth
has Mrs. Malcolm <span class="nowrap">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Here again we see Mohammed giving his
people what we may call ‘nursery rules,’ treating
them as children, while our Master expects
us to grow up so that we can arrange these matters
for ourselves. The very fact that the detailed
rules of Mohammedanism are binding through
life shows that the Mohammedan is not expected
to grow up as we understand growing up.”<a id="Anchor-77" title="Go to Footnote 77" href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The African
Child at Worship.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="183"><a id="Page_183"></a></span>
Once more the Child at Worship, this time in
the African jungle! “Ancestor-worship is the
highest form of African Fetishism,&mdash;the usual
fetish is the skull of the father, which the son
keeps in a box. The father occasionally speaks
to the son in dreams, and frequently communicates
with him by omens. He helps him in all
his enterprises, good and evil, and secures his
success in love, in hunting, and in war. All
those who have skulls are a secret society, which
is powerful to rule and to tyrannize over others.
Young boys are initiated into this society by
rites and ceremonies that are revolting.... In
the mild ceremony of the more civilized Fang
towns, the boy who is to be initiated is made
very drunk and taken blindfolded to the bush,
to a place set apart for the use of the society.
The ceremony continues several days. In one
part of it the bandage is removed from his eyes
at midnight, a low fire is burning, which gives a
feeble light, and he finds himself surrounded by
members of the society with faces and bodies
frightfully distorted, and all the skulls of their
ancestors exposed to view, together with the
heads of persons who have recently died. Some
one asks him what he sees. He replies that he
sees only spirits, and solemnly declares that these
are not men....</p>

<p>“Further up the river, a boy during initiation
is usually placed for several days in a house alone,
after being made to look so long at the sun that
<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a id="Page_184"></a></span>
sometimes he faints, and when he is taken into
the house he cannot at first see anything. Meantime
the door is closed, and they all go away.
Gradually he sees things around him, and at
length discovers opposite him a corpse, in an
early state of decomposition. He is kept there
day and night during the ceremony. The men
visit him and subject him to all sorts of indignities,
in order to impress him with the necessity
of absolute obedience to the society.... They
believe that the skull of the father or other
ancestor, when it has been properly prepared,
becomes the residence of the ancestor. The son ...
will keep the skull comfortably warm and
dry, occasionally rubbing it with oil and red-wood
powder, and will feed it bountifully.”<a id="Anchor-78" title="Go to Footnote 78" href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Our hearts are touched by the child in its helplessness,
by the suffering and sorrow of neglected

widows, and the yearning cry for teachers and
books, but how can we endure it when all that is
sweetest and holiest and best in the beautiful
child heart is defiled and polluted in the name of
religion; when senseless repetition in an unknown
tongue takes the place of the trustful words, “Our
Father”; when sticks and stones, ancestral

those to whom the Christ cries out in yearning
love, “Suffer the little children to come unto

<strong class="fakesc">ME</strong>”? If our hearts are touched, not to the

these horrors must cease, and the children will
be taught to worship aright, and Christ “shall
see of the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied.”</p>

These and many similar questions meet the
missionary on furlough, and cause her more woe
than does many a hard experience on the mission
field.
The best answer to such questions is to
induce the questioners to study carefully what
the non-Christian religions have to say regarding
children, and the direct result of their systems
on child life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the Koran.</div>

<p>A careful search in the Koran, the sacred book
of the Mohammedans, is rewarded by finding
several passages strictly enjoining kindness and
justice to orphans, and a set of minute regulations
regarding inheritance in which children, parents,
husbands, and wives shall share, prefaced by
these words: “God hath thus commanded you
concerning your children,” and followed up later
by the remark: “Ye know not whether your
parents or your children be of greater use unto
you.” (Sura <abbr title="four">IV</abbr>.)</p>

<p>“Children,” says <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. M. Zwemer, “are
scarcely mentioned in the Koran; of such is not
the Kingdom of Islam.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Hindu
Vedas.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="186"><a id="Page_186"></a></span>
“The Hindu Vedas enjoin that by a girl, or by
a young woman, or by a woman advanced in
years, nothing must be done, even in her own
dwelling place, according to her mere pleasure;
in childhood a female must be dependent on
(or subject to) her father; in youth, on her husband;
her lord being dead, on her sons; a woman
must never seek independence.” (Manu <abbr title="five">V</abbr>, 158.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Hindu
Shastras.</div>

<p>“The Hindu Shastras have made no provisions
of affection and regard for a daughter. She is
viewed by them, as far as her parents are concerned,
merely as an object to be ‘given away,’
and that as soon as possible. She is declared by
them to be marriageable, even in her infancy, to
a person of any age; and of course without her own
choice or intelligent consent.... According to
the letter of the law, the parents are not to sell
their daughters, but they may receive valuable
gifts, the equivalent of a price, on her behalf.”
(Manu <abbr title="three">III</abbr>, 51.)<a id="Anchor-79" title="Go to Footnote 79" href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The code of Manu further teaches that by
honoring his mother a son gains the terrestrial
world, by honoring his father, the ethereal,&mdash;intermediate,&mdash;and
by assiduous attention to his
preceptor, even the celestial world of Brahma.<a id="Anchor-80" title="Go to Footnote 80" href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>How different are the words of the Apostle
Paul regarding the relation between parents and
children. “Fathers, provoke not your children
<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a id="Page_187"></a></span>
that they be not discouraged. Children, obey
your parents <em>in the Lord</em>. Honor thy father
<em>and thy mother</em>, which is the first commandment
with promise.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confucianism
and Christianity.</div>

<p>The Right Reverend Logan H. Roots, Bishop
of Hankow, has illustrated so forcibly the difference
in the practical working out of the precepts
of Confucianism and Christianity, that it
is well worth while to quote him at length.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In conversation with a group of Chinese gentlemen
some time ago, I made the remark that outside the Jewish
and Christian religions there was no serious recognition of
the inherent dignity of children, and that no sage had
ever made a statement comparable to that of our Lord.&mdash;“Suffer
the little children to come unto me and forbid
them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.” Such
a remark as this on my part would have elicited scarcely
any interest a few years ago. The warm discussion it
aroused this time was a sign of the new life that is now
stirring among the Chinese. The keenest of these gentlemen
were in sympathy with Christianity, but they were
all inclined to look upon Confucianism as a real preparation
for Christianity, and one after another brought forth
sayings of the Confucian sages which they thought could
be reasonably compared to that of Christ.</p>

<p>They quoted the praises of King Wen in the “Great
Learning,” where it is said, “As a father he rested in
kindness”; the sayings of Confucius himself in the
“Analects” as to his own wish: “In regard to the young,
treat them tenderly”; the advice to a ruler in “The Great
Learning”: “Act as though you were watching over an
infant”; and the fine saying of Mencius: “The great man
is he who does not lose his child’s heart.”...</p>

<p>The eagerness of these gentlemen in discussing the
question with me, to find a place for their worthies in
<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a id="Page_188"></a></span>
the ample folds of Christian teaching is far from unwholesome
or blameworthy, especially when there is such readiness
as they showed to appeal to Christian teaching rather
than to the sages as their standard, and to prove the
greatness of their sages by their agreement with the
Christ....</p>

<p>My purpose, however, is not to give an exposition of
these classical gems, but rather to contrast them briefly
with certain popular Chinese conceptions of childhood
which are foolish or cruel, but which these lofty sayings
of the sages have been powerless to correct.</p>

<p>Should a child fall ill, his relatives or friends very likely
remark, “His spirit has gone seeking another incarnation.”
Or some one suggests, “Some ghost has frightened the
child to the point of losing its soul.”... Should the child
die, the parents will grieve as surely and as sorely as
parents any where; but ... they will be told, “Never mind,
the child was misguided to your home, and was not intended
for you.” Or, “It was only a creditor collecting a
debt you owed in a former existence.” Or, “Don’t
grieve, it was but one of those demon spirits that always
die young.”...</p>

<p>I put these popular sayings beside the exalted sentiments
of the Chinese Classics, not to disparage the sages,
but to show how utterly dark the popular mind is, in
spite of these sayings which seem so full of light. Is not the
difficulty that the sages after all could not go to the root
of the matter? They knew nothing of God as Father.<a id="Anchor-81" title="Go to Footnote 81" href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Failure to
influence lives
for righteousness.</div>

<p>What is here illustrated of the failure of Confucianism
to influence lives toward righteousness
and faith is true of the other non-Christian
religions. Even the young Mohammedan girl
realized the power and claim of Christianity as
she was a chance listener to the Gospel story
<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a id="Page_189"></a></span>
while a missionary toured in central Persia. “Why,
lady,” she exclaimed, “if one understands clearly
that Book, there is nothing left but to obey!”</p>

<p>The direct results of the way children are
taught to worship in non-Christian lands deserve
careful, unprejudiced study, with the question
constantly in mind, “Is this religion good enough
for <em>my</em> children, or for those in whom I am
interested?” If the study results in a negative
answer to the question, it is fair to ask further,
“Is it good enough for <em>any</em> children in the whole
wide world?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Result to the
child of <a id="tn_4">religious</a>
acts.</div>

<p>What should be the results, physical, mental,
moral, and spiritual, of a child’s religious acts?
Which of all the world religions produces these
results? Study Mohammedanism, for instance,
of which we have already noted some of the
religious acts expected of the child. These
must necessarily inculcate formalism, thoughtless
repetition, deep-rooted superstition, and the idea
that God can be appeased and sin can be forgiven
through certain acts unconnected with life
and character.</p>

<p>“When I die,” said a poor, blind Mohammedan
girl, “I shall be visited by two angels, the chief
of whom will make an examination of my deeds,
and remind me of everything I have done, and
left undone; he will then cut off a piece of my
shroud and record upon it my good and bad
deeds, and attach it firmly to my neck with a piece
of rope. If my good deeds outweigh my bad ones,
<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a id="Page_190"></a></span>
I shall go straight into heaven. If my bad deeds
outweigh my good deeds, my intercessor Mohammed
will easily get permission for me to enter
heaven, so it does not much matter how I live.”<a id="Anchor-82" title="Go to Footnote 82" href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mohammedan
month of
mourning.</div>

<p>The annual month of mourning of the Shi’ite
Mohammedans is observed by children as well
as by adults, and little ones with their heads
covered with straw or ashes, or wearing chains,
are borne on horseback in the processions that
close the series of passion plays. A missionary
in Persia saw a mother carrying her boy of five
or six years in the bloody procession, cutting
his head with a curved sword, while blood
streamed from five or six gashes. Poor, eager,
zealous mother, trying to store up merit for her
baby boy against the day of wrath!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fear and horror
in idol worship.</div>

<p>Fear, dread, and horror are inseparably associated
in the minds of thousands of children with
the worship of their gods. From earliest childhood
others grow so naturally into the forms of
ancestor, idol, and spirit worship that this becomes
one of the most difficult factors in leading
them into Christianity. From the <cite>Mission
Day Spring</cite> we quote a few words about “how
Chinese children worship.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We must go up a flight of wide stone steps at the entrance
of the temple, and as we enter we shall see two tall
images with very ugly faces and brilliantly painted coats,
which are called “Guardians of the Gate.” The mothers
bring their little children forward, and teach them to clasp
<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a id="Page_191"></a></span>
their hands and bow down, knocking their heads to the
ground as they worship the image. If it is the first time,
the children are afraid and often say, “Oh, I can’t do
it, I never can do it!” Then they have to watch closely
while their mothers once more show them how to worship.
Afterwards they are sometimes rewarded with little
presents, which they are told have been given them by
the idol. If they are still too afraid to worship, stories
of the terrible things that happen to people who do not
ask the protection of the idols are repeated to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Up on the mountain slopes of the Hakone
District in Japan, is the great children’s god,
Jizo, carved centuries ago out of the solid rock.
The heathen mother has been taught that, when
the souls of her little children pass over the sullen
stream of death, they must be saved from the
clutches of a cruel hag residing on the banks.
She steals their clothes and forces them to the
endless task of piling stones at the river side.
In order to induce Jizo to save them from the
hag, the weary heathen mother climbs the steep
paths leading to the children’s god, and there
makes her supplication. And the little one tied
to her back or led by the hand, with highly strung
nerves and weary limbs, shrinks in terror at the
sight of the ugly idol, and at the stories of dire
vengeance which will befall her unless she worships
properly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death from
fright and
exposure.</div>

<p>Many children die from the effects of fright and
exposure connected with religious rites, as in the
case of some of the African boys whose initiation
into ancestor worship was described above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soul-stains.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="192"><a id="Page_192"></a></span>
Worse <a id="tn_5">than</a> all the results yet mentioned
are the deep soul-stains, the utter ruin of all
moral and spiritual character, which fall to the
lot of countless thousands of innocent children
through the direct influence of their religion. One
longs to turn away from scenes like these, but we
mothers, sisters, and daughters of Christian homes
cannot be honest with ourselves and with our
God, unless we are willing to know things as they
really are, in order to help to make them as they
really ought to be. Such conditions exist to a
larger or smaller degree in many lands, but to
be really understood in their baldest, most revolting
form, it is only necessary to visit India.
Bishop Caldwell says that “the stories related
of the life of the god Krishna do more than anything
to destroy the morals and corrupt the imaginations
of Hindu youth.”

<span class="sidenote">Temple girls.</span>

The temple girls,
nautch girls, and muralis are living witnesses to
India’s need of a pure and holy religion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nautch-girl often begins her career of training
under teachers as early as five years of age. She is taught
to read, dance, and sing, and instructed in every seductive
art. Her songs are usually amorous; and while she is
yet a mere girl, before she can realize fully the moral
bearings of her choice of life, she makes her debut as a
nautch-girl in the community.</p>

<p>Khandoba is the deity of the Marathi country and is
popularly believed to be an avator, or incarnation of
Shiva. Muralis are girls devoted to him by their parents
in infancy or early childhood. Outside the main entrance
of the temple court, a stone column stands on the wall
on the left side. It is about three feet high, and on the
<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a id="Page_193"></a></span>
head of it is cut a filthy design. The column is called by
the name of Yeshwantrao.... He it is who gives children
to barren women.... It is to this image the poor deluded
women promise to sacrifice their first-born daughters if
Khandoba will make them mothers of many children.
Then after the vow, the first-born girl is offered to Khandoba
and set apart for him by tying a necklace of seven
cowries around the little girl’s neck. When she becomes
of marriageable age she is formally married to the Khanda
or daggar of Khandoba, and becomes his nominal wife.
Henceforth she is forbidden to become the wedded wife
of man, and the result is that she usually leads an infamous
life, earning a livelihood by sin.<a id="Anchor-83" title="Go to Footnote 83" href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stories told by Amy Wilson Carmichael
and many others corroborate and emphasize
the facts stated by Mrs. Fuller, and tell of what
the British Government and Christian missions
are trying to do to counteract and stop the
monstrous evil. From the <cite>Missionary Review
of the World</cite> for February, 1913, we <span class="nowrap">quote:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Legislation to
abolish young
temple girls.</div>

<p>“A bill lately introduced into the viceroy’s
legislative council by Mr. Dadabhai, the Parsee
member of that body, touches upon some of
oldest and darkest social evils of India. It
proposes to make it criminal for a parent or other
lawful guardian to dedicate a girl under sixteen
years of age to ‘the service of a deity,’ which
always means dedicating her to a life of infamy,
and to make the crime punishable with ten
years penal servitude. It prohibits under very
severe penalties, the practice which obtains
whereby priests enter into temporary alliance
<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a id="Page_194"></a></span>
with young girls thus dedicated, in order to
initiate them into the life of professional profligacy.”
To this we may add from an authoritative
source that in 1913 the native state of
Mysore had already abolished dancing girls
from all its temples.</p>

<p>While the British Government is trying to
prevent any of India’s daughters from being
hereafter ruined, body and soul, in the name of
religion, what is being done for the thousands
who through no fault of their own have already
become “the servants of the gods”? Is it possible
to do anything to redeem the lives of these
children whose earliest memories cluster about
the most hideous forms of evil?</p>

<p>Another picture. A group of women lounging within
the temple enclosure in the cool shade of the fragrant
cork trees. A beautiful little girl of five years is running
up and down the great stone steps of the tank, laughing
and playing. Now and then one of the women calls the
child to her and tries the effect of some article of <a id="tn_6">jewelry</a>
against the bright little face. Little Moothi, the Pearl
of the Temple, as she is called, is full of life and happiness.
Too young to understand the sin and wrong about her,
she loves the bright jewels and silken garments, the
excitement of the dancing and singing. The daily exercise
on the whirling wheel is only fun for her. She never
grows dizzy and falls off as do her stupid companions, to
be beaten by cross old Ramana, their teacher. “She will
bring plenty of money by and by,” said one of the women
to Moothi’s mother. “You had better let her go to the
Christian school in the village. She will be taught to
read and sing without any expense to you, and there is
no danger of her remembering what she hears of that
<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a id="Page_195"></a></span>
foolish religion.” But the mother’s face did not light up
in response. Sitting in her little hut she has listened to
the Gospel as it was told to a group of outcast women who
had gathered weekly in the village palim on the other side
of the wall. The wonderful story had penetrated her
dark heart. But it is too late for her. She is too old
to change, but oh, that her little Moothi, her beautiful
one, might be spared the life of sin and shame to which
she is doomed as a dancing girl devoted to the service of
the temple. What can she do? Through the long nights
she thought and thought, until finally she came to the
decision to part with the little one though her heart
break. One night she took the child with a little bundle
of clothing and stole away. After weary miles of travel
she appeared at the home of a missionary and begged her
to take the little girl. “I give her to you,” she said,
“to be taught your religion, and to be your child, but she
must never know who her mother was.” She laid down
twenty rupees which she had saved toward her support,
and disappeared, leaving no clue to her name and village.</p>

<p>There was consternation among the women of the
temple when it was discovered that Moothi was gone,
but the mother gave no sign, and it was finally concluded
that some one had stolen her because of her beauty, and
such things are too common in a heathen land to cause a
disturbance. As Moothi grew and developed into a
beautiful Christian woman and earnest worker, the
missionary often wondered whence came the God-given
trust so strangely sent. Now and then, but less frequently
as the years pass on, a woman, growing increasingly
old and bent, was seen near the school, whom they
associated with Moothi, but no one knew until upon her
deathbed she sent for the missionary and told her story.
Only a heathen mother, degraded and heart-broken,
parted from her only joy in life, watching hungrily in the
distance for a sight of the loved face. Can we not believe
that the Christ of love was revealed to her heart also?<a id="Anchor-84" title="Go to Footnote 84" href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heathen mothers
and their
dead children.</div>

<p>While our hearts go out in tenderness to the
heathen mother deprived of her living child,
what can we do or say to comfort the mother
whose little one is cold in death? Our statistics of
infant mortality in Chapter <abbr title="one">I</abbr> give some slight
idea of the vast multitudes of mourning mothers
for whom there is no hope, no knowledge that,&mdash;“around
the throne of God in heaven, thousands
of children stand;” no vision of Him who
“shall gather the lambs with His arm and carry
them in His bosom.” Nowhere but among
Christians do hope and faith and self-control and
comfort abide in the house where death has
come, and none but the Christian cemetery is a
place of order and beauty and peace. Among
the Thonga Tribe of South Africa, the mother
who loses a baby is considered deeply contaminated
with the defilement of death. She must
bury the child alone, not even her husband
helping her. Mrs. George Heber Jones said
recently that in all her many years of life in
Korea she had never seen any funeral service
for a child of non-Christians. The baby is
buried anywhere at the back of the house as a
dog would be, or put up in the branches of a
tree for the vultures to find. Do the mothers
have hearts and feelings? Listen to the experience
<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a id="Page_197"></a></span>
of Mrs. U. S. G. Jones of India, and
answer the question for yourselves.</p>

<p>“I went into a Brahmin home where several
widows were gathered. One old woman with
eyes that were dimmed from much weeping said,
peering into my face, ‘Yes, it is the same, I was
sure of it. You came here some ten or twelve
years ago, and told us how when your beloved
were taken from you, you did not mourn and wail
as we did. When my daughter died, I tried to
recall what you had said about another life
and hope beyond the grave, but I could not
remember. Tell it all again now.’ So I told
her again of our glorious hope and of the resurrection.
How earnestly they all listened! Poor,

<p>“The Child for Christ” must be the watchword

not get the saving power of Christ upon him;
the sense of the native worth and value of being
a Christian in soul and character; the desire to
lift him out of ‘the natural man’ to ‘the measure
of the stature of the fulness of Christ.’ If that
motive be not strong enough to inspire us with
zeal for taking the blessing of Christ to the
heathen, then Christ has still much work to do
upon us to make us Christian in mind and
spiritual sympathy.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The means to
be used.</div>

<p>If it is our duty and privilege to win the
children of the world to Christ, how is it to be
done? What special means are our missionaries
using to bring about this result? All missionary
work for children, in the homes, in day school
and boarding school, in church and Sunday-School,
in hospital and orphanage, must have the
great two-fold aim ever in view,&mdash;to win the child
to Christ, to train the child for Christ. It remains
for us to study briefly several agencies not
yet touched upon, that have been greatly blessed
in their effect upon children of many lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sunday-School
statistics.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="199"><a id="Page_199"></a></span>
First in the list of these child-winning agencies
stands the Sunday-School. From a series of
statistics appearing in the January, 1913, number
of the <cite>Missionary Review of the World</cite>, we
take the following figures, concerning Sunday-Schools
conducted by the Protestant Missionary
Societies of the world.</p>

<p>Would that every Christian woman who
glances at these figures could dimly realize what
they stand for,&mdash;the efforts, the time and energy
and love expended, the disappointments and
trials, the encouragements and victories. One
must <em>never</em> be discouraged, one must <em>never</em> lose
faith and hope, one may <em>never</em> stop sowing seeds
in little hearts, even though the work seems as
small and insignificant as it did in the Japanese
Sunday-School at Kawazoe.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Japanese
Sunday-School.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Every Sunday at twelve o’clock the children begin to
clatter up on their wooden shoes to a Sunday-School
which does not begin till two o’clock.... When it begins
they sing hymns vigorously if not tunefully, and listen
as patiently as any children of the same age. The nurse
girls, aged ten or eleven, come with babies on their backs,
and, if the babies remonstrate too vigorously, they are
trotted out in the sunshine for a breathing space. An
average of forty children come every Sunday to hear the
<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a id="Page_200"></a></span>
Christian stories, and often, passing on the street, one
hears the familiar tune and unfamiliar words of “Jesus
loves me.” One, two, or more Sunday-Schools seem like
but a drop in the bucket in a town of twenty thousand
people, but we can only hope that through hymn, or
story, or picture, or card, the good news of the love of
God may be spread more widely.<a id="Anchor-87" title="Go to Footnote 87" href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But many “drops” fill a bucket, and some day
Japan is going to feel the mighty power of the
children who have been taught in mission Sunday-Schools.
Here is a prophetic <span class="nowrap">instance:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote2">A Sunday-School
rally in
Japan.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>The teachings which produce the sweetest and most
beautiful things in the lives of children, and will make
them the truest and best “soldiers and servants” are those
given in the Sunday-Schools which are multiplying in
Japan. Therefore there is no work better worth doing
than that in the Sunday-Schools, and no service more
valuable than that of the missionaries who teach the
children of Japan.... On the Campus of the Reformed
Church College, Sendai, there was held last summer a
union gathering of the Sunday-Schools of the city. Some
of them were Saturday Sunday-Schools, as there were not
hours enough on Sunday for the Christian teachers to
instruct all those who are eager to learn, and it is not
unprecedented for two or three Sunday-Schools to be
taught by the same persons. When the pupils in the
Christian schools of Sendai came together they were
one thousand seven hundred strong. An eye-witness
<span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I wish you could have seen them! Our own four Sunday-Schools
furnished one hundred and fifty of the number.
It did my heart good! Do missions pay? Oh, my, no!
One of our students in the training school is the direct
result of the Sendai Sunday-School, and another from
<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a id="Page_201"></a></span>
that Sunday-School enters next year. And to hear those
one thousand seven hundred children sing! And back
of that great gathering was the story of long and patient
labor, days of constant effort, and nights of discouragement.”<a id="Anchor-88" title="Go to Footnote 88" href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">A Sunday-School
with
practical
results.</div>

<p>With such a view of the value of the Sunday-School
to Japan, it is interesting to note that in
May, 1913, there were one thousand seven
hundred Protestant Sunday-Schools in Japan,
with an enrollment of about 100,000 pupils. If
the question is asked, Do the Sunday-Schools
have any effect on the lives of the children?
it is a pleasure to answer with a brief extract
from the personal letter of a new missionary
to <span class="nowrap">Japan:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“This afternoon a lady called whose mother
belongs to the nobility and has older ideals, but
her father is American. She is a most earnest
Christian and has done a great deal. She has
access to the nobility’s children and is forming
a Sunday-School, but she has many discouragements.
At one village they had started a school
of two hundred, and the children were showing its
influence, but the schoolmaster feared just this
and so managed to frighten the parents that all
were withdrawn. This village was built in
terraces with a long flight of stairs, down which
many blind people went. The boys used to hang
cords across so as to trip them. But now they
have begun to take these poor people by the
<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a id="Page_202"></a></span>
hand, and lead them down.” A Sunday-School
that can teach such practical Christianity to
mischievous boys must be a power in the community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sunday-School
Parade
in Peking.</div>

<p>In October, 1911, the city of Peking, China,
witnessed a Sunday-School parade in which two
thousand children took part. With banners
flying, and led by the Methodists with six hundred
children and a band, the parade passed through
the most important streets of the city to a
large church where a children’s mass meeting
was held.</p>

<p>A noteworthy “forward movement” was undertaken
by the Methodist Episcopal Church in
1913, when the <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> Wallace H. Miner, son of
a missionary, sailed for China, to become a
Sunday-School worker and organizer in that new
republic. His work will be to assist the missionaries
in promoting the work of the Sunday-Schools,
to instruct native preachers in methods
of Sunday-School organization and administration,
and to train local teachers and native
field workers, introducing modern methods into
Chinese Sunday-Schools as far as they are
adapted to Chinese conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sunday-School

in India.</div>

<p>Would that India had more men like the
rich coffee planter who gives his services to
Christian work, and who travels from end to
end of India organizing Sunday-Schools. The
statistics of the Sunday-School Union of India
are deeply significant, as is also the fact that
<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a id="Page_203"></a></span>
there <em>is</em> such a Union. “The Sunday-School
Union of India has a membership of 458,945,
being an increase of 37,866 on the previous
year. The Union stands for the very best in
Bible instruction, equipment, and management.
It publishes 10,000,000 English and vernacular
pages of Scripture illustrated expositions, nearly
all of which are based on the international
syllabus. To meet the needs of Sunday-Schools
in fifty languages, there are about fifty editions
of ‘helps’ in twenty languages. A prominent
feature of the Union is that it stands for salvation
through Jesus Christ, and membership
in the church to which it belongs.”<a id="Anchor-89" title="Go to Footnote 89" href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An African

<p>It would be fascinating to visit the Sunday-Schools
in various lands, and to hear the same
dear children’s hymns sung in many languages
by black children and white, red, and brown.
We have time for only a peep at an Egyptian
Sunday-School, but even this glimpse shows
how naturally and inevitably the love and power
of Jesus Christ can change the heart and life of
a little child.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 2 P. M. the beating of the bell has the desired effect,
and presently there rises up from the edge of the river a
crowd of some of the dirtiest and yet some of the prettiest
little boys and girls you ever saw. Nearly every little
girl carries perched on her shoulder a baby brother or
sister. They rush without ceremony into the compound,
but there they are intercepted, and made to walk quietly
and orderly into the classes provided for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="204"><a id="Page_204"></a></span>
A kind Syrian nurse from the Hospital takes her place
in a class of some thirty or forty girls, and, if only you could
peep behind the scenes, you would hear such sad stories
connected with the lives of several of her girls. Some
have been married and cast aside by their husbands for
some trivial fault, and then how glad they are once more
to find their way back to school, where they know they
are loved and cared for.</p>

<p>A blind girl sits among a class of the very naughtiest
but sweetest little folk, who try her patience to the utmost.
A kind missionary takes another class, and I am sure
that, although she is accustomed to teaching all through
the week, she has never taught such pieces of humanity
as those before her. Still another class of mischievous
little boys is taught by one of the day-school boys, who
sometimes has to appeal to the superintendent to restore
order.... Now the bell has to be beaten, gently too,
and, after much noise, all shaggy heads are bent in prayer,
then sentence by sentence, the Lord’s Prayer is said, and
a very elongated “Amen” comes in at the end. Now
three rooms are occupied instead of one, for if all the
classes were kept in one room the noise would be deafening.
What are all those dirty little bags hung around the
children’s necks? Ah! those bags contain the most
precious thing the children have, <abbr title="that is">viz.</abbr>, an old Christmas
card which serves as a register. If by some unfortunate
chance that ticket gets lost, genuine tears form a streamlet
down the troubled little face of the owner, for he or
she knows it is just a mere chance if the superintendent
will relent so far as to provide another, and yet without
it admittance to the yearly Christmas tree is a thing
impossible.</p>

<p>These registers are marked and a tiny box handed
around to receive many little widows’ mites, for although
the children are of the poorest, we try to teach them that
it is more blessed to give than to receive. And now we
are all in the room again, and a time is spent in catechising
<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a id="Page_205"></a></span>
the whole school so as to make sure they have been listening
to their lesson. The story had been told of the ten
lepers, and the ingratitude of the nine, who went away
without saying “thank you.” Z., a very regular member,
looked up with glowing eyes, and said, “I would very
much like to say thank you to Jesus for all He has done
for me, but I am afraid He would not care to bend His
hand from heaven to let a little girl like me kiss it.”...
Another little girl is all eagerness to speak. Her name
means “Cast Out,” and when her turn comes she says,
“I love pickles, oh! so much, and when my mother
said, ‘Go to the market and bring back pickles in vinegar,’
I used to dip my fingers into the vinegar all the way
home,&mdash;they would creep into the basin in spite of myself,&mdash;but
now since my teacher has told me it is like
stealing, I try not even to look at the basin, but run all
the way home with it to my mother.”<a id="Anchor-90" title="Go to Footnote 90" href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It would take pages to tell what Junior Christian
Endeavor Societies, Epworth Leagues, and
similar organizations are doing for the children
of Asia and Africa, and how through them the
children of Christian households are being
trained to live and work for Christ,&mdash;a training
which most of their parents lacked in childhood.
A missionary from Japan tells how a little fellow
prayed at the Christian Endeavor meeting, “Oh
God, I just want to thank you for the good
time we had last Saturday, I can taste it yet;
help us not to forget what we promised then.”</p>

<p>A Junior Endeavor Society in the Madura
District in India helps to support a Sunday-School
in a near-by village, the children bringing
<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a id="Page_206"></a></span>
their offerings of one pie each (one sixth of a cent)
with noble regularity. In one boarding-school
in Persia, four or five Endeavor Societies flourished
some years ago, and, when the girls went
home for their vacations, they led the singing
in the village churches, teaching the congregations
new hymns learned at school. Each girl
saw to it that a Christian Endeavor Society was
formed in her village during the long summer
vacation. Often the school girl would be the
only member of the Society who could read, but
she gathered the village children about her, and
taught them to repeat Bible verses, sing hymns,
and offer simple prayers, and a great deal of
training and teaching can be accomplished in one
summer vacation!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The power of
the Bible.</div>

<p>What marvelous power there is in the Word
of God! A Mohammedan boy in a fanatical
Persian city, which had often been visited by
colporteurs and missionaries, went one day to
the bazaar where he saw a New Testament being
torn up to serve as wrapping paper. He remonstrated
with the shopkeeper, and finally bought
what was left of the Book. Through its influence
both he and his mother were led to Christ. In
another Persian city, the missionary holds a
Bible lesson for boys under fifteen every Friday,
when they do not have to be at work. Picture
cards sent by thoughtful friends in America are
earned by boys learning the Lord’s Prayer, the
Ten Commandments, or verses from the Sermon
<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a id="Page_207"></a></span>
on the Mount. Some of the boys always repeat
the lesson at home to their mothers, and some
say openly, “If what the Bible says is true, the
Mohammedan religion is vain and useless.”
Truly, “the entrance of Thy word giveth light.”</p>

<p>Do American children prize their Bibles as
does this Korean boy?</p>

<div class="sidenote2">A Korean boy

<blockquote>
<p>Every day in the village of Nulmok there is an exodus
of small boys to the mountain for fuel. Wood being
scarce, it becomes necessary for each household to furnish
a fuel gatherer. This army of boys is winding its way
to the mountains some five miles off. Each boy has tied
to his jikcey, or rack carried on his back, a small package
of rice. This is his dinner, for it is an all-day job. As
they make their way up the well-nigh barren slopes, one
boy notices that his friend Kaiby has a second little bundle
tied to his jikcey, and so he hails him to know why he is
carrying two dinners.</p>

<p>“Oh, one is for my body, and the other is dinner for
my soul,” he replies.</p>

<p>After a morning spent in raking over a small area of
the mountain, each boy has succeeded in getting together
his bundle of dried grass, and all sit down beside a mountain
brook to eat of their dinner of cold rice and a relish
of greens or pickled cabbage in season. Soon Kaiby has
finished his meal and is untying his second bundle; taking
out a book he begins to read aloud, slowly, while the other
boys gather around to hear. It is about a great Man,
who, when the people wanted to make him king, went to
the mountain to pray.</p>

<p>Day after day at rest time Kaiby got out his book and
read from it, and the other boys were interested. About
this time, Ki Mun Ju, the Bible Society agent, came
again to the village with Bibles. After supper, Kaiby,
accompanied by several other boys, asked if there was
<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a id="Page_208"></a></span>
not a smaller copy of the New Testament, as a number of
the boys wanted to buy a Bible, but their only opportunity
to read was at rest time on the mountain, and a
smaller copy would be more easily carried. Needless to
say, the colporteur did not fail to bring some on his next
trip, and now many of the boys have their own, and
frequently the hymnbook which they treasure next is
tied up with it.<a id="Anchor-91" title="Go to Footnote 91" href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Hymnbooks
and singing.</div>

<p>Korean boys are not the only ones who treasure
the hymnbook and love to learn and to sing
Christian hymns. The missionary who can play
and sing, and the one who knows enough about
music to translate hymns and adapt tunes, has
marvelous opportunities to work effectively among
children. Miss Ford’s experiences in Palestine
illustrate the truth of <span class="nowrap">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I should like to say a word about the use of
the organ. We are able sometimes to have very
large Moslem audiences in the villages. Scores
of boys will gather around to hear. When we
propose to teach them a hymn or chorus they
eagerly agree to learn. The subject of the song
is always salvation in Jesus Christ, and the way
of life is pointed out. We often hear the children
afterward singing these hymns in the streets....
God has given us large numbers of little children
to bring to Him. They learn hymns and psalms,
chapters of the Gospels, and verses from the
Bible with great facility, and they love to sing
the hymns. Now also we can use with profit,
<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a id="Page_209"></a></span>
large, illustrated, highly colored pictures of the
life and teachings of our Lord, as well as Old
Testament stories.”<a id="Anchor-92" title="Go to Footnote 92" href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Obstacles to
bringing children
to
Christ.</div>

<p>Lest anyone be tempted to think that the work
is always easy, that one has but to sow the seed
in order without further work and prayer to
reap a bountiful harvest, it is but fair to mention
a few of the obstacles that missionaries must
constantly meet while trying to win children to
Christ. Heredity, age-long custom, superstition,
fatalism, the shackles of caste and prejudice,
the home influences that so quickly counteract
what a child learns during a few brief hours at a
mission compound,&mdash;all these and many other
hindrances must be reckoned with and overcome.
Miss Carmichael graphically describes
some of these experiences of effort and disappointment
in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miss Carmichael
on discouragements
in India.</div>

<p>“Often we hear people say how excellent it is,
and how they never worship idols now, but only
the true God; and even a heathen mother will
make her child repeat its texts to you, and a
father will tell you how it tells him Bible stories;
and, if you are quite new to the work, you put
it in the Magazine, and at home it sounds like
conversion. All this goes on most peacefully;
there is not the slightest stir, till something
happens to show the people that the doctrine
is not just a creed, but contains a living Power.
And then, and not until then, there is opposition.
<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a id="Page_210"></a></span>
In one village there was a little Brahmin child
who often tried to speak to us, but was never
allowed. One day she risked capture and its
consequences, and ran across the narrow stream
which divides the Brahmin street from the
village, and spoke to one of our band in a hurried
little whisper, ‘Oh, I do want to hear about
Jesus!’ And she told how she had learned at
school in her own town, and then she had been
sent to her mother-in-law’s house in this jungle
village, ‘that one,’ pointing to a house where
they never had smiles for us; but her mother-in-law
objected to the preaching, and had threatened
to throw her down the well if she listened to us.
Just then a hard voice called her and she flew.
Next time we went to that village she was shut
up somewhere inside.”<a id="Anchor-93" title="Go to Footnote 93" href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">“After many
days.”</div>

<p>Sometimes God grants that bread cast on the
waters with loving, lavish hand, is found again
after many, many days. Often a Bible verse
or the words of a hymn, or the recollection of
what was seen and heard in a missionary home,
has not been forgotten, and has borne fruit in
after life. “A rich Japanese silk merchant sent
for the missionaries in his town, and entertained
them most hospitably. He told how as a child
he had attended a Sunday-School. ‘Very often,’
he said, ‘right in the midst of my business the
words of the hymn, “Jesus loves me, this I know,”
come to me, and, try as I may, I can’t get them
<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a id="Page_211"></a></span>
out of my mind.’ He then repeated the hymn
from beginning to end, and added, ‘Though I
have lived my life without religion, I feel that it
is the most important thing there is, and I want
my little girl to be a Christian; and it is for that
purpose,’ he added emphatically, ‘that I have
placed her in the mission school, that she may
become a Christian.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ours is the
greater
privilege.</div>

<p>Do we realize the privilege and opportunity
that is ours to pray and give and go, to send
our money and our sons and daughters, that
the children of many Christless lands may learn
to know and love and serve the children’s Friend
while they are young, and hearts and minds are
plastic and teachable? Have we as keen an
insight into the great truths of Christian privilege
as had the little Chinese girl, who, after being
publicly baptized, was asked by her teacher,
“Are you glad of the privilege of attending a
school where you can hear of the Lord Jesus?”
Quickly she responded, “Are <em>you</em> not glad, teacher,
that you are in China, where you can teach of the
Lord Jesus?”<a id="Anchor-94" title="Go to Footnote 94" href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Yes, ours is the greater privilege,
and we must see to it carefully that we do not
miss any part of the joy that the Master has in
store for us. Our own children are so cunning
and lovable, so full of wonderful possibilities,
and in need of so much care and watchfulness,
that it is easy to forget the other children who
also need our love and help. In the Saviour’s
<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a id="Page_212"></a></span>
eyes there is no difference,&mdash;He loves and cares
for <em>all</em> children. Shall we imitate Him in this
respect?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A missionary’s
dream.</div>

<p>A weary missionary fell asleep, and as she slept
she dreamed a dream. A message had arrived
that the Master was coming, and to her was
appointed the task of getting all the little children
ready for His arrival. So she arranged them on
the benches, tier on tier, putting the little white
children on the first benches, nearest to where
the Master would stand, and then came the
little yellow and red and brown children and
far back on the farthest benches sat the black
children. When they were all arranged, she
looked, and it did not seem quite right to her.
Why should the black children be so far away?
They ought perhaps to be on the front benches.
She started to rearrange them, but just as all
was in confusion, the children stirring around,
and each trying to find his proper place, footsteps
were heard, and lo! it was the Master’s tread,
and He was coming before the children were
ready. Overcome with shame and confusion
she hung her head. To think that the task entrusted
to her had not been accomplished in
time! So she stood while the footsteps drew
nearer and nearer, till finally they paused beside
her, and she was obliged to look up. And lo!
as she did so, and her eyes rested on the children,
all shades of color and difference had vanished,&mdash;the
little children in the Master’s presence were
all alike!</p>

<h4>CASTE IN INDIA</h4>

<p>In the village of the Wind a young girl became known
as an enquirer. Her Caste passed the word along from
village to village wherever its members were found, and
<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a id="Page_214"></a></span>
all these relations and connections were speedily leagued
in a compact to keep her from hearing more. When we
went to see her, we found she had been posted off somewhere
else. When we went to the somewhere else (always
freely mentioned to us, with invitation to go), we
found she had been there, but had been forwarded elsewhere.
For weeks she was tossed about like this; then
we traced her and found her. But she was thoroughly
cowed, and dared not show the least interest in us....
Take a child of four or five, ask it a question concerning
its Caste, and you will see how that baby tree has begun
to drop branch rootlets....</p>

<p>The young girls belonging to the higher Castes are
kept in strict seclusion. During these formative years
they are shut up within the courtyard walls to the dwarfing
life within, and as a result they get dwarfed, and lose
in resourcefulness and independence of mind, and above
all in courage; and this tells terribly in our work, making
it so difficult to persuade such a one to think for herself.
It is this custom which makes work among girls exceedingly
slow and unresultful.</p>

<p>A few months ago a boy of twelve resolved to become a
Christian. His clan, eight thousand strong, were enraged.
There was a riot in the streets; in the house the poison
cup was ready. Better death than loss of Caste. In
another town a boy took his stand and was baptized,
thus crossing the line that divided secret belief from open
confession. His Caste men got hold of him afterwards;
next time he was seen he was a raving lunatic. The Caste
was avenged! (Amy Wilson Carmichael in “Things as
They Are.”)</p>

<h4>SPIRIT-WORSHIP AMONG THE LAO</h4>

<p>Spirit-worship, as existing among the Lao, is not reduced
to a system as is Buddhism. It has no temple, but
it is enshrined in the heart of every man, woman, and
child in the country.... Children are seen with soot marks
<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a id="Page_215"></a></span>
upon their foreheads. These are placed there by spirit-doctors
and are to ward off evil. They also wear around
their wrists charm-strings. This belief is by no means
confined to the peasantry.</p>

<p>Every person is believed to have thirty-two good
spirits pervading his body, called kwan. As long as these
kwan all remain as guardian spirits within, no sickness or
mishap can befall the person. But alas! these kwan
are freaky, vacillating spirits, and may leave the body
without a moment’s warning, and at once sickness or
accident befalls. Much time and money are spent trying
to keep these kwan in a good humor, so that they will
not desert the body....</p>

<p>The folk-lore of this people is pregnant with this belief
in magic and spirit-worship, and so the children at the
knee learn to reverence and fear both, and in after years
when the saner reason of maturity would assert itself,
this belief has become a habit too deeply ingrained in the
mind to be cast aside. (Lillian Johnson Curtis in “The
Laos of North Siam,” Westminster Press.)</p>

<h4>SUNDAY-SCHOOL&mdash;NINGPO, CHINA</h4>

<p>I wish some of you might be here tomorrow to go with
me to my Sunday-School for heathen children. This is
a school which had to be discontinued for some time, and
I re-opened it on Easter Sunday, with the assistance of
nine of our older girls and pupil teachers. One hundred
were present last Sunday, including some girls from our
two mission schools, and a few visitors. The majority
of the children are very poor and dirty, and they are
learning to sing “Jesus loves me, this I know,” with as
much gusto as though they were as clean as pinks, and
they carry away with them a lesson leaf and a picture
card, to try to tell at home what they have learned that
day. I quite forget they are Chinese children, for their
human nature is very like that of the children at home.
One Sunday, two little girls from our mission school, clean
<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a id="Page_216"></a></span>
and comfortably dressed, were sitting on the front seat,
when I brought in three little heathen girls, soiled and
untidy, to sit beside them. Whereupon one of the clean
little girls drew herself off in one corner, gathering her
clothes close about her for fear of touching the others;
while the second clean little girl moved toward the soiled
children and shared her hymnbook with them, pointing
out each character as we sang. Did you ever know any
little children at home who acted as did these two Chinese
children? (Edith C. Dickie in <cite>The Foreign Post</cite>.)</p>


<h3>BIBLE READING</h3>

<p class="mem">“Suffer the little children.” Mark 10:13&ndash;16.</p>


<p>Various ways in which Christ’s disciples hinder the
children,&mdash;consider them too young,&mdash;too irresponsible,&mdash;feel
that adults have the first claim to Christ’s time and
attention.</p>

<p>How different was Christ’s attitude! “In His words
over the little children, Christ has lifted childhood into
a type of character, and has given children their share in
the Kingdom of God.” (Shailer Mathews.)</p>

<p>The touch of Christ on a little child’s life brings blessing.
Are we bringing the children to Him or forbidding
them? “The place for the lambs is in the fold.” (Woelfkin.)</p>

<p>Unless the children of today are brought to the
Master and trained for His service, the outlook
is dark indeed for coming generations. If
every child now living could be brought under
Christian influences, receive a Christian education,
and be sent out to live and work for Christ,
what a marvelous transformation this world
would experience! In a conspicuous place on the
wall at a recent Sunday-School convention hung
a banner with the words “Childhood is the
Hope of the World,”&mdash;the same thought that was
embodied in the remark of a prominent Japanese
Christian, who said to a missionary, “The grown-up
people are so ignorant and set in their ways,
they will not become Christians, but <em>the hope
is in the children</em>.”<a id="Anchor-95" title="Go to Footnote 95" href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

“He who helps a child,” says Phillips Brooks,
“helps humanity with a distinctness, with an
immediateness, which no other help given to
human creatures in any other stage of their
human life, can possibly give again.” Here is a
challenge to all who believe that the world needs
hope, that humanity needs help, that God needs
human agents to carry out His plans, that Christ
needs the child!</p>

<p>What is there for the child of today,&mdash;the

that are awaking out of age-long sleep?</p>

<div class="sidenote4">Changes in
Japan.</div>

<p>Sixty years ago Japan was in darkness. What
great transformations have taken place since
Commodore Perry sailed for Yedo Bay in November,
1852! As a commercial, military, and naval
power Japan has been taking her place with the
important nations of the earth. We have already
learned that her educational system contains
much that might well be copied in Western lands.
The manner in which Japan is “catching up”
with nations that have had centuries of advantage
over her reminds one of the educational experimenters
who claim that a child need not be
bothered with mathematics until he is ten or
twelve years old, and that he will then speedily
“catch up” with children who have toiled over
their mathematics since they were of kindergarten
age. During the serious outbreak of
bitter feeling in Japan regarding the proposed
Alien Land Holding Bill pending in the California
<span class="pagenum" title="225"><a id="Page_225"></a></span>
Legislature, a large reception was tendered in
Tokyo to <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> John R. Mott, Hamilton Wright
Mabie and <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Peabody. In the course of his
address, Count Okuma, who is not in any sense a
Christian, remarked that diplomacy, the courts,
and commercial interests were alike helpless to
maintain peace on earth and good will among
men. “The only hope,” he said, “is in the power
of Christianity and in the influence of Christians
to maintain peace and righteousness in the spirit
of brotherly love.”<a id="Anchor-96" title="Go to Footnote 96" href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
census in
Imperial
University.</div>

<p>Not only from a political point of view, but
far more from an intellectual and religious point
of view, is Japan in great, urgent need of what
Christianity can give her. “It seems from the
figures of a religious census recently taken in the
Imperial University of Japan at Tokyo, that of
the students in attendance, three-fourths of
them declare themselves agnostics, while fifteen
hundred are content to be registered as atheists.
That leaves only five hundred of the whole
student body to be accounted for: and of these,
sixty are Christian, fifty Buddhist, and eight
Shinto.... The educated classes of Japan have
practically broken with Shintoism and Buddhism,
and are looking around for some better basis
for ethics and faith. The issue in Japan is no
longer between Christianity and Buddhism, but
between Christianity and nothing.”<a id="Anchor-97" title="Go to Footnote 97" href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>


<div class="sidenote">Kindergarten
children in
after-life.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="226"><a id="Page_226"></a></span>
Side by side with this pregnant statement we
place a few sentences from the Sixth Annual
Report of the Kindergarten Union of Japan.</p>

<p>“What influence has the kindergarten on the
lives of its graduates in later years? From many
churches we hear of them as church members
doing active service, like one young man who has a
class of twenty-five boys in Sunday-School.
As teachers, as mothers, in many walks of life,
they are showing the power of Christ in their
lives, and all, whether Christians or not, are
better men and women for their training in
Christian schools.”</p>

<p>The inference is so obvious that we need not
comment upon it. Rather let us do our share
to multiply the agencies that can embody in
their reports such incidents as the following from
the American Church Mission Kindergarten at
<span class="nowrap">Sendai:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“More than ever before have we emphasized
Christianity as the center of our thought and life,
and feel much encouraged to go much farther
next year. Yearning over our graduates, who,
when they leave us, may be separated for a long
time from Christian teaching, we earnestly
desired to see Christianity move definitely forward
in their hearts, so far as may be for little
children. So we based the last month’s work on
<abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:6&ndash;11. This seems deep, but was found
helpful by the teachers.... Just before graduation,
in the free talk at luncheon hour one day,
<span class="pagenum" title="227"><a id="Page_227"></a></span>
a boy whose parents were about to move to Akita
said most disconsolately, ‘There won’t be any God
to take care of me when I go to Akita!’ ‘Oh,
yes, there will,’ said Taguchi San, who, seeing his
need of a broader understanding of the Omnipotent
God, told of the God of all the earth, and
that He cared for us wherever we go, even when
farther than Akita.”<a id="Anchor-98" title="Go to Footnote 98" href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">China’s
awakening.</div>

<p>China’s awakening has been so sudden and so
rapid that even while the Christian women
of America were studying “China’s New Day,”
many facts in that up-to-date text-book became
ancient history. A few of the startling contrasts
between the Old China and the New were indicated
in the <cite>Congregationalist</cite> of April 24, 1913.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Associated Press despatches from Peking on Thursday
of last week reported that the Chinese Government has
made an appeal to all the Christian churches in China to
set aside April 27&mdash;next Sunday&mdash;as a day of prayer for
the Chinese National Assembly, for the new Government,
for the President of the new Republic yet to be elected,
for the constitution of the Republic, for the maintenance
of peace and for the election of strong and virtuous men
to office. Representatives of provincial authorities are
instructed to be present at these services....</p>

<p>Thirteen years ago this coming summer the Imperial
Government of China hunted and slew her Christian
subjects like wild beasts and brought all of the resources
at her command to aid in driving the hated religions of
the “foreign devils” from her shores. Today the new
Republic solemnly and officially sets apart a day and urges
all her Christian subjects, as well as foreigners, to assemble
<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a id="Page_228"></a></span>
and, in the presence of the officials, intercede for those
things which Christian nations seek and supremely value.</p>

<p>In 1900 a despatch was sent from the throne to all
viceroys of all the provinces to exterminate all foreigners,
and the streets of Peking were placarded with posters
threatening with death all who provided them refuge.
A few weeks ago the President of the Republic, Yuan Shi
Kai, addressing in Peking an assembly of delegates to the
Annual Convention of the <abbr title="Young Men’s Christian Association">Y. M. C. A.</abbr>, said:</p>

<p>“You, my friends, who are members and delegates to
this Christian Association from every province of the
Republic, are examples for the men of every class of society.
By the help of your guiding light and uplifting
influence, millions of young men, well equipped, morally,
intellectually, and physically, will be raised up in this
nation to render loyal service to the Republic in her time
of need, and lift her to a position that shall add to the
civilized world an undying luster.”</p>

<p>China is doing her part to make amends for the past
and to demonstrate to the entire world the sincerity of
her purpose. Undoubtedly this is the first time in history
that such an appeal has been made by a non-Christian
nation. With commendable promptness both the Federal
Council and Committee of Reference and Council
of the Foreign Missionary Societies of North America
have asked the churches to intercede for China.</p>

<p>Was there ever a more striking proof of the presence of
God in the life of the world and of His purposes for men
in Jesus Christ the universal Saviour? Was there ever
greater encouragement to use the mighty enginery of
united prayer for a specific end?</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Sun Yat Sen.</div>

<p>Listen to the testimony of the son of a prominent
Christian official in <span class="nowrap">China:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Where did the Chinese Republic ever come
from? You say from the reformers and revolutionists.
You don’t go back far enough. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
<span class="pagenum" title="229"><a id="Page_229"></a></span>
Sun was in a large measure responsible for it all,
but where does he come from? Where did he
get his principles of freedom and equality?
These were instilled into his heart by a missionary,
and who was he? He was a follower of Jesus
Christ, and in China for the direct purpose of
teaching how Jesus came to save the world....
Blot out of China today the education which
owes its origin to Jesus Christ, and where will
China be? In the depth of deepest ignorance.”<a id="Anchor-99" title="Go to Footnote 99" href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Sun Yat Sen, by many considered “the first
citizen in the hearts of his countrymen,” spoke
with no uncertain sound of China’s greatest need
in this time of her crisis. “Brothers,” he said,
when addressing a number of Chinese students,
“applied, practical Christianity is our true need.
Away with the commentaries and doubts. God
asks your obedience, not your patronage. He
demands your service, not your criticism.”<a id="Anchor-100" title="Go to Footnote 100" href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Applied
Christianity in
China.</div>

<p>“Applied, practical Christianity,” is what the
missionaries are trying to give China, and can
any part of their work be more practical or more
important than what they are doing for the children
who are soon to be the statesmen and educators,
the military and social leaders, the
fathers and mothers of the great new Republic
of the East?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Li Bi Cu.</div>

<p>Many pages might be filled with true tales of
how Chinese children, won to Christ in early
<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a id="Page_230"></a></span>
life, have brought blessing and uplift to hundreds
in their land. The story of <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Li Bi Cu and her
mother is a wonderful illustration of what <em>might</em>
be multiplied many thousands of times if there
were always some one ready to rescue girl babies
and to give them a fair chance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Li Bi Cu is one of China’s new women. A forceful
speaker, using perfect English, with a charming personality,
<abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Li Bi Cu never fails to win the hearts of her
audiences. Those who heard her at Northfield can never

dress, to the women of the United States to come to the
help of her countrywomen. The mother of <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Li Bi Cu
was rescued from the street, where she had been thrown
to die, when only a day or two old, and taken to a mission
school, where she was cared for, educated, and trained as
a Bible woman. She married a Methodist minister, Mr.
Li, and her daughter, Li Bi Cu, grew up in a Christian
home. One of the missionaries, seeing unusual ability in
the young girl, brought her to America for a more thorough
education than China afforded. She studied in Folts
Institute, and later entered the Women’s Medical College
in Philadelphia. Graduating with honor, she returned
to China after eight years’ residence in the United
States and was sent to the Fukien Province, where the
Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church had opened a hospital, and where she
has cared for the souls and bodies of thousands of patients.<a id="Anchor-101" title="Go to Footnote 101" href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>A charming sequel to the story shows how this
splendid Chinese woman is ready at a moment’s
notice to do her duty as a Christian citizen of the
world. She was passing on her return to China
<span class="pagenum" title="231"><a id="Page_231"></a></span>
a point not far from Chicago, when the train
struck a track laborer and suddenly stopped.
The injured man, a Russian by birth, was brought
aboard, and <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Li, hearing of the accident,
volunteered her help. Then was seen the curious
combination of a Chinese Christian woman

baggage car!<a id="Anchor-102" title="Go to Footnote 102" href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>“Applied, practical Christianity” is being
taught to the mothers of China, and some of
them are responding in a way that augurs well for
the future of their children and their land. Mrs.
T. N. Thompson of Tsining writes of a recent
women’s convention to which Christians came from
far and near, some from a distance of sixty miles.
Women spoke from the platform with ease,
spirit, and eloquence. Some of the subjects
discussed were:&mdash;Equal authority of husbands
and wives&mdash;Partiality between sons and daughters&mdash;Duty
of sending girls to school&mdash;Cleanliness and
order of the home as taught in mission schools&mdash;Dedication
of children to the Lord. The subject
of marriage engagements was thoroughly canvassed,
and many laughed heartily at reminiscences
of old heathen days when children were
betrothed in <a id="tn_8">babyhood</a>.”<a id="Anchor-103" title="Go to Footnote 103" href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> “Old heathen days!”
And yet it is but one hundred years since Robert
Morrison baptized his first Christian convert,
and but fourteen years since the great Boxer
<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a id="Page_232"></a></span>
uprising tried to rid the land of all Christians.
Thus it was ordained long centuries ago when
God “appointed a law in Israel, when He commanded
our fathers, that they should make them
known to their children; that the generation to
come might know them, even the children that
should be born, who should arise and tell them
to <em>their</em> children.” (Psalm 78:5, 6.) From father
to son, from mother to daughter, the knowledge
of God’s love and Christ’s salvation is to be
transmitted, and those who gain that knowledge
in early childhood are the ones on whom China
can surely depend in the important years to
come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work for the
children in
India.</div>

<p>“The children born of Christian parents in
India,” says <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> E. A. Arnett in the Sunday
School Times, “are probably not more than
half a million, but upon the thorough and systematic
character of the religious work done among
these depends the hope of the future of the
church of India. These are to be the army for
India’s conquest. The day of opportunity is
soon to come to India as it has come to Japan
and to China. A great crisis is approaching when
there will be a death-grapple in the open between
Christianity and the opposing forces. Then
will be needed as never before an Indian church,
rich in men and women able and fit for the fight.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Indian
girl redeemed.</div>

<p>That India’s children with all their handicaps
are capable of being made “fit for the fight” can
be abundantly proven. A letter from a missionary
<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a id="Page_233"></a></span>
friend tells of a little Indian protege, now a
grown woman, who was the child of a drunken
father and a half crazy, evil-tempered mother,
who, in a brawl, lamed her poor baby for life.
The child was sent away to school after her
father’s death, and it seemed as if it were to prove
her salvation. But at the age of fourteen the
old evil propensities broke forth. She became
foul-tongued, irreverent, disobedient, and diseased.
She was sent to visit her mother, then an inmate
of an insane asylum, where the girl was placed
under observation and declared to be a moral
degenerate. The fact that she was perfectly
satisfied to stay at the asylum was a cause of great
distress to her missionary friend, and soon a
number of earnest workers banded themselves to
pray for her “literally night and day.” A
wonderful change came over the girl; the seed
sown in earlier years sprang up and bore fruit.
She asked to be allowed to leave the asylum,
and soon after taking a position she gave her
heart to Christ. Far out on the western frontier
of India, a woman, growing in grace and character,
is compounding medicines, and otherwise helping
in a mission hospital, occupying a difficult
and trying position. Oh! was she not worth
saving,&mdash;that little, lame, degenerate baby, born
in the degradation of darkest India, and accomplishing
a work today that you or I could
not do?</p>

is to reconstruct and upbuild and guide through

<div class="sidenote">Persian school

<p>The boys’ school at Teheran, Persia, has won
the name of a “factory”! Among the Mohammedan
boys brought here, is a little fellow whose

factory where you manufacture men. Do you
think you can turn out a man from my boy?”<a id="Anchor-104" title="Go to Footnote 104" href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Such “factories” are needed throughout Turkey
and Persia, and those who know the boys of
these countries will assure you that they are
capable of turning out to be <em>men</em> if they have the
proper opportunities. When the self-supporting
Christian boarding school for Mohammedan
boys was started in Teheran, the missionaries
naturally felt a good deal of concern as to the
results of such an experiment. The actual results
are thus reported,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Not only has it been somewhat more than
self-supporting financially, but, thanks to the
<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a id="Page_235"></a></span>
co-operative plan initiated from the beginning,
into which the boys entered with enthusiasm,
and in which they showed a most admirable

management and government was taken by the

It is well to remember that the children under
missionary influence are being trained not only
for what they can be and do in the future, when
they are grown up, but are being taught to use
<em>now</em> what they have learned, for the benefit of
others. Listen to the report of what some
Syrian girls did during a summer vacation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“An hour ago I came home from Sunday-School which
we are having this summer. We began it the first summer
we came to K. ... and twenty children attend. We
are teaching them lessons from the Old Testament, and I
think I can say that our school is a real success this year.”</p>

<p>“I am teaching some children Bible stories and have
given one of the boys two papers to make a study of some
chapters which I have appointed for him.”</p>

<p>“I brought a new Bible with me, and I try to teach our
servant to read it.”</p>

<p>These few extracts are from letters which I have received
this summer showing how Beirut school-girls are trying to
give expression to the pass-it-on spirit. All over the
country they are busy according to their opportunities.
I know of one little girl who last year was in the lowest
class of our Preparatory Department, but this year has a
school of seventeen every Sunday afternoon during the
vacation. One of her older brothers and a boy cousin
taught classes, but she was both organizer and superintendent.</p>

<p>One of the pleasantest gatherings we shall have this
fall will be the Report Meeting, when we shall hear from
all the pupils about results of their summer efforts for
others. Fourteen took certain Bibles home with them,
promising to use them in teaching others to read.<a id="Anchor-107" title="Go to Footnote 107" href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

Christ need the children of these lands to be at
work for Him?</p>

<p>Let us try to realize that each unit of these
vast figures stands for a life that was once an
innocent little child, born into conditions or
surroundings similar to those of which we have
been studying in this book. Think of the future
tragedies that may be averted if each little child
today is redeemed and begins to work for Christ.

<span class="sidenote">What a slave
boy accomplished.</span>

Why should there not be thousands of averted
or transformed tragedies like those surrounding
the life of the little black boy, born in 1806 on
the West Coast of Africa? Because of certain
peculiar circumstances at his birth it was prophesied
<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a id="Page_238"></a></span>
that he was not to be a devotee of any
idol, but one “celebrated and distinguished to
serve the great and highest God.” At one time
when the house of his prosperous father caught
fire, the little boy rushed in and saved the idols.
Whereupon it was commonly said,&mdash;“This child
will be a great worshiper of the gods; he will
one day restore the gods to our nation.”</p>

<p>When the child was about fifteen, a raid was
made upon the village by Mohammedans, and
a large number of women and children were led
away captive with ropes around their necks,
young Ajayi and his mother and grandmother
among the number. Sold from one person to
another, often bartered for rum or tobacco, he
finally fell into the hands of Portuguese traders.
He and his fellow slaves were rescued by an
English man-of-war from the Portuguese vessel,
and he was educated by the Church Missionary
Society. He became a school-master, then
preacher, and finally Bishop of the native Church
on the Niger. Fourah Bay College, where he
pursued a part of his studies, was founded as a
result of the conviction forced upon the Church
Missionary Society that, if Africa were to be
evangelized, it must be done chiefly through
native agency, because of the devastating effects
of the climate on foreigners. In other words,
<em>Christ needs the children of Africa</em>, to be trained for
Him in places where no one else in the wide
world can accomplish the task.</p>

Our story of The Child will not be complete
unless we pay close attention to one of the great
fundamental policies of Christian missions,&mdash;alluded
to above,&mdash;that the work of world evangelization
must be accomplished chiefly through
trained natives of the countries where the Gospel
is not known. And these agents, in order to be
most efficient and successful should be won to
Christ in early life. The methods used by Bishop
Selwyn in the New Hebrides were so successful
and interesting and illustrate this point so thoroughly
that it will pay us to study them.</p>

<div class="sidenote2">Methods of
Bishop Selwyn
in the Pacific Islands.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Bishop Augustus Selwyn, of the Episcopalian Church of
New Zealand, proposed to secure children of the natives
in the new fields, educate these children in schools of a
Christian country, and send them as pioneer missionaries
to their own peoples. He proposed, also, that, after these
children had overcome the pagan opposition, white
missionaries should be introduced for co-operating with
them. “The white corks,” he said, “were for floating
the black net.”</p>

<p>With this in view, in 1848, he made a voyage of exploration
in <abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship
">H. M. S.</abbr> Dido as far as to the Loyalty Islands.
Observing that the Fijis, the Southern Hebrides, and several
other groups were occupied by other religious denominations
which were doing successful work, he chose for his
field the groups not thus occupied. These were the
Northern Hebrides, Banks, Santa Cruz, Torres, Reef,
and Solomon Groups....</p>

<p>Over these islands the trail of the Serpent has extended.
A wilder, more besotted, and fiercer people than their
inhabitants it would be hard to find. With the exception
of the natives of the Santa Cruz and Reef Islands, they
<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a id="Page_241"></a></span>
all were formerly cannibals, and those of them in the
Solomon Group were also head-hunters....</p>

<p>The work of procuring boys proved to be difficult and
perilous. By great tact and a kind and courteous manner
the Bishop secured in his first trip five. In process
of time he was able to employ the boys, who had been
some time in his school, to do the soliciting, and then he
was more successful. Each succeeding year the natives
received him with greater cordiality, and more readily
supplied his vessel with stores of taro, yams, and fruit.
The number of boys in the school has been one hundred
and fifty to two hundred.</p>

<p>On Norfold Island a thousand acres of land were purchased
for the school at a cost of ten thousand dollars.
In this tract a beautiful chapel was built, and around it
houses for the teachers and pupils. The land was very
fertile, and was easily made to produce almost all the food
the school needed. The boys were taught the gospel of
work. They were trained in the mechanic trades, the
cultivation of the ground, and the care of livestock; and
to each of them was committed a small garden for him
to cultivate for himself. They were kept in the school
six to ten years, and then taken, as teachers, to their
homes or to other islands.</p>

<p>In 1854 <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Coleridge Patteson joined the
mission. He had been moved when fourteen years of
age, by a sermon of Bishop Selwyn, to devote himself
to the missionary cause. In 1861 he was consecrated as
the First Bishop of Milanesia....</p>

<p>The Milanesians who have embraced Christianity
have ceased from their cannibalism, their head-hunting,
and their warfare, and have become an humble, upright,
and peace-loving people. In 1905 the number of baptized
persons in the groups of the mission was 2,811, of white
missionaries, 41, of native teachers, 689, of mission stations,
200.<a id="Anchor-110" title="Go to Footnote 110" href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Away up in the Karen Hills of Burma the first
mission tour of exploration to a certain point was

singers. On associating with the Red Karen
children, they quickly made acquaintance and
were valuable workers. Great was the enthusiasm
among the little Red Karens when classes
were formed in reading and singing, and with
surprising quickness they learned from their eager
young teachers, who were glad to pass on to other
children what they had so recently acquired
themselves.<a id="Anchor-112" title="Go to Footnote 112" href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="243"><a id="Page_243"></a></span>
Not only are the children under missionary
influence trained to <em>work</em>, but they are also
taught the joy and privilege of giving. Here
is the method employed by Mrs. McCauley of
Japan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sunday-School children in Keimo <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 1 and <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2,
Tokyo, under Mrs. McCauley, take up a collection every
Sabbath.... The children coming from heathen homes
cannot ask their parents for money to put into this collection,
so must practice self-denial to be able to give.
The money for a boiled sweet potato purchased near
the school building from a vendor, two rin, is saved by
taking a smaller potato, and the lunch is none the less
palatable because the child has made a little sacrifice, and
these two rin, as they rattle in the collection box, are music
in his ears and joy&mdash;the joy of giving,&mdash;in his heart. I
happen to be one of the Auditors of the accounts at the
Leper Home, and this year we closed the books with deficit,&mdash;a
debt of two hundred and sixteen yen,&mdash;and we were
troubled, having no resources. I looked over the Sunday-School
collections, and found we had in the treasury nearly
twenty-five yen, and I told the scholars about the dear little
girl just thirteen, who is a leper and can never again be well,
but is the light of the Home. When the women get
discouraged and cry, this little angel puts her arms about
them and says, “Auntie, dear Auntie, don’t cry; we will
soon, all of us, have new bodies.” Two boys of fifteen
are there&mdash;their companions like themselves are lepers.
“Now, children, we need money; you have some; will
you give it there, all or some part of it? How many
say all? Let us see the hands”: and every little hand,
kindergarten and all, went up, and we made it twenty-five
yen to send to the Treasurer of our Leper Home.
I then told them to tell their parents of how we spend the
money given by the little ones, and we reviewed the
places we had helped from our mite: For five years an
<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a id="Page_244"></a></span>
Ainu School; Red Cross Society, two years; Charity
Hospital, two years; Okayama Orphanage, two years;
destitute soldiers, one year; comfort bags during war;
famine sufferers, one year; flood sufferers, one year;
earthquake sufferers, one year; Lepers’ Home, <em>this year</em>;
medicine for sick pupils, often; help at funerals for poor
families of school.</p>

<p>These children when they grow up and enter the church
will be systematic givers and know what benevolence
is.<a id="Anchor-113" title="Go to Footnote 113" href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Missionary

<p>It brings tears to the eyes and joy to the heart
to see how eagerly children of one mission land
devote their little gifts to sending the Gospel to
children of some other land. It seems the most
natural thing in the world to lead them into
missionary giving, and many a children’s band
in America might be put to shame by the joy
and spontaneity of those who are themselves
objects of missionary giving.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One day early in the fall,” writes Miss Alice B. Caldwell
of Marsovan, Turkey, “while walking in the school
garden I noticed two little girls strolling up and down
the path arm in arm. They were chattering in their
vivacious way, and one of them was making her crochet
needle fly as fast as her tongue. On my inquiring what
she was making, she held up a dainty bag, and several
little interpreters informed me that it was for the Christian
Endeavor Bazaar. After that day I saw many busy
fingers on the playground making the most of the hours
out of doors.</p>

helping our own Christian land because they
were won to Christ in childhood on the mission
field? We are thinking of one young woman
whose parents became Christians under missionary
influence, and who grew up in a Christian
home among many persecutions and adverse circumstances
from without. When, in the course
of time, her widowed mother immigrated to
America, the girl, already a devoted Christian,
entered a training school in this country. Today
she is working in six languages for thousands of
immigrants in a New England city,&mdash;doing a
work that few Americans could ever hope to
accomplish. Merely as a business investment or
a patriotic effort, the money contributed to the
Mission Board, which brought about this result,
has been more than profitable.</p>

<p>Here is the record of another good investment
made in <span class="nowrap">China:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some years ago there entered the True Light Seminary
a bright little girl of thirteen, who, under the wise and
gentle training of Miss Noyes, gave her heart to Christ
and united with the church, becoming thereafter one of
the best pupils in the school. Her great desire was to
become a teacher, but since three years of age she had
been betrothed by her father to the son of a heathen
family&mdash;the betrothal by Chinese law being almost
equivalent to a marriage&mdash;it became her duty to fulfil
the promise made for her, and at the completion of her
<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a id="Page_246"></a></span>
course of study she married the man of her father’s
choice. The marriage did not prove a happy one; the
husband’s business took him much away, leaving his
wife alone, and at the end of three years he died suddenly
of plague. The young wife, thus unexpectedly set free
for service, at once took up her desired work, and after
teaching for three years in Hongkong was called to a
position in a Congregational school in Canton....</p>

<p>In the spring of 1910 it came about that one of the
benefactions of Mr. Andrew Carnegie came to the Occidental
Home in San Francisco, and when the question
arose as to what should be done with the gift it could but
seem that the long-sought opportunity had come to secure
a Chinese teacher to live with the girls in the Home
and to train them in their own tongue.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Yeung Mo Owen, or Mrs.
Yeung, as she is known in America, led in these various
ways, became an inmate of the Mission Home in San
Francisco, teacher of Chinese to the girls, both in the
Home and in the Occidental Board Day School, and
incidentally a blessing not only to the Home and to the
Chinese Church, but also to Chinatown, and to the
Board itself....</p>

<p>“I have never seen such a lovely face, never been so
impressed by a Chinese woman,” said one long in the
work in California. “Now you see what our native
Christian women are like,” quickly responded a missionary
who was present.<a id="Anchor-115" title="Go to Footnote 115" href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Missionary
children at
work.</div>

<p>The story of the Child at Work for Christ would
not be complete without making mention of the
missionary children who in such large numbers
are trying to do their share toward bringing the
Kingdom of Christ to this world. “If one life
shines, the life next to it must catch the light,”
<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a id="Page_247"></a></span>
and the joy and privilege of mission service in
all its beauty,&mdash;and in all its trial and discouragement
as well,&mdash;are well known to the missionary
boy and girl. Even little four year old Annie
had her share of discouragement when her parents
returned to their field of work after a furlough
during which Annie had forgotten all
languages but English. When she heard her
mother speaking of women’s meetings and
various forms of work as she took them up, one
by one, Annie decided to do her share also. Picking
up her dolly, she trotted down to the gate to
be a missionary to the little Turkish girls next
door. Sadly she came back again to report,
“Mother, the children cannot speak the American
language.”</p>

<p>Let no one think that because missionary
children are “used to” the country and the
language, the climate and food and presence of
the “natives,” it is always easy and natural for
them to return to their parents’ field of labor.
Just because they have been familiar with it all
from childhood, the surroundings and opportunities
of the homeland,&mdash;their own rightful
heritage,&mdash;seem desirable beyond words and
hard to relinquish. To the missionary children
who return to the field, the halo of romance surrounding
the step is non-existent,&mdash;they go with
open eyes to what they know about. And yet
they go, large numbers of them, and it might be
well to ask of your Mission Boards whether their
<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a id="Page_248"></a></span>
services are valuable to the cause or not. A
newspaper clipping a few years ago gave these
<span class="nowrap">statistics:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Nearly one-third of the missionaries of the
American Board of India and Ceylon are the
children or grandchildren of missionaries who
were sent out by the Board two or three generations
ago. In the three India missions, including
Ceylon, there are now ninety-five American laborers,
nineteen of whom were children and
eleven grandchildren of missionaries.”</p>

<p>It would be interesting to get the statistics
of other Missions and Boards on this subject
and to compare the results of their work with
some of the psychological statements quoted in
the early chapters of this book regarding heredity
and early training.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
children at
work for
Christ.</div>

<p>What part are our own precious children in
Christian America to have in this great subject,&mdash;the
Child at Work for Christ? Are they
alone to be left out, or to have but a paltry share
in the glorious work of giving the Gospel of
Christ to the whole world? If the work is worth
doing, if the result justifies the effort, <em>if the
children of the world need Christ</em>, then it is unjust,
unfair, un-Christian, to deny <em>our</em> children a share
in the labor and the reward. Nor may we deny
them the training and teaching that will make
them realize not only the need, but&mdash;the one
only adequate way in which that need may be
satisfied. A few words from the pen of <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a id="Page_249"></a></span>
William Adams Brown emphasize very practically
the need of this “only adequate way.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many persons today who are ready to recognize
the beneficent work done by foreign missionaries for
the social welfare of the peoples among whom they have
been working, who have no sympathy with the religious
motives which animate them. Why, they ask, can we
not have the hospital and the school without the doctrines
that go with them? They forget that it is faith in
the realities which the doctrines express which alone has
made the missionary enterprise possible. Had it not
been for the belief that man is an immortal spirit capable
of communion with God, and meant for fellowship with
Him throughout all eternity, we should have had no
Livingstone or Moffatt or Paton. James Russell Lowell
saw this clearly when he spoke the striking sentences
which have often been quoted, but which will bear quoting
<span class="nowrap">again:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“When the keen scrutiny of skeptics has found a place
on this planet where a decent man may live in decency,
comfort, and security, supporting and educating his children
unspoiled and unpolluted, a place where age is
reverenced, infancy protected, womanhood honored, and
human life held in due regard,&mdash;when skeptics can find
such a place ten miles square on this globe, where the
Gospel of Christ has not gone before and cleared the way
and laid foundations that made decency and security
possible, it will then be in order for these skeptical literati
to move thither and there ventilate their views. But so
long as these men are dependent on the very religion
which they discard for every privilege they enjoy, they
may well hesitate to rob the Christian of his hope and
humanity of its faith in the Saviour who alone has given
to men that hope of eternal life which makes life tolerable
and society possible, and robs death of its terrors and the
grave of its gloom.”<a id="Anchor-116" title="Go to Footnote 116" href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

Is there anything more beautiful and spontaneous

learned to give to others because of its love for

training their children to give have a great

<blockquote>
<p>Says <cite>The Spirit of Missions</cite>: “There is an old Scotch
proverb that ‘Mony a mickle maks a muckle.’ Nowhere
is this more effectively demonstrated than in the Lenten
offering given each year by the Sunday-Schools of the
church. This movement was begun thirty-five years
ago in the diocese of Pennsylvania, and almost at once
it spread throughout the church. Year by year the
volume of gifts has grown, until for the whole period they
have reached the amazing sum of $2,618,290.86. The
gifts which have produced this result have come from
all quarters of the earth and from all manner of children.
Youngsters in Alaska have shovelled snow and others in
California have raised flowers to earn their money for this
purpose. The negro boys and girls of Africa, the peons
of Mexico, the Igorotes of the Philippines, and the brown
and yellow children of Japan and China have gathered
the odd coins of their several countries in common with
the children of the mountains and prairies, the small towns
and the great cities of the United States.”<a id="Anchor-117" title="Go to Footnote 117" href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>One who had spent some years in India tells
of an experience in Chicago that brings the quick
tears to one’s eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From Chicago
to India.</div>

<p>“I had been telling the children at Olivet
Institute in Chicago of the little girls in Fatehgarh
who called Christmas the Great Day and who
had never had any Great Day to look forward to
<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a id="Page_251"></a></span>
at all until they had come to the mission school;
of Gunga De, who had worked so hard to deserve
a doll on the Great Day and learned the Beatitudes
and her psalms and prayers, only to have
her Hindu father take her away to bathe in the
Ganges so that she would miss the prize giving,
and of her joy when she found the doll waiting
for her the next day. Afterwards as I stood
waiting for the car on a dreary sordid Halstead
Street corner, a little stranger who had wandered
into the meeting came and stood beside me.
A thin shawl was over her head, and the hand
that held it together under her chin was thin and
blue with the cold. There were dark circles
under her eyes, and the little face had no look
of childhood about it.</p>

<p>“‘Say, missus,’ she began, ‘you forgot something.’</p>

<p>“‘What did I forget?’ I asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>“‘You forgot to tell us how we could send
things to those children out in India. I’ve got
a doll&mdash;she has no head&mdash;but I like her&mdash;and
two picture cards. Maybe I will get some
more, so I would like to send those.’”<a id="Anchor-118" title="Go to Footnote 118" href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p>Perhaps some mother may fear that if she
trains her child to feel a personal responsibility
<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a id="Page_252"></a></span>
for the children of far-off lands the day may
come when the dear one will look into her face
and say, “Mother, I must go. I hear the call
to tell others of the Christ whom I love!” Blessed
is that mother who can answer, though there
may be a sharp catch of the breath and a tightening
of the heart strings, “If He call thee, thou shalt
say, ‘Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.’”
A mother can never afford to let her child lose
out of its life the very best and highest possibility,
and when God calls to a service, there is
nothing greater that can come to a life than the
blessing found in the pathway of obedience.</p>

<h3>QUOTATIONS</h3>

<h4>PRAYING CHILDREN IN KOREA</h4>

<p>Sometimes little children learn about Jesus in some way
and become Christians before their parents do. Three
years ago, after a meeting in the country at a place called
Top Chai, in Korea, two small boys, each nine years old,
<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a id="Page_254"></a></span>
came up and told me that they were friends and had been
believing in Jesus for a year, but that none of their parents
had been Christians. They said, “We want you to
pray every day with us that our parents may believe in
Jesus.” I wrote their names in a little book and did
pray as they asked me to, and every time I met the boys
after that I would ask if their parents had become Christians
yet. “No,” they would say, “not yet, but they
are going to.” Last spring, just before I left Korea, I
went to Top Chai to say good-bye, and one of the boys
came to me with the brightest smile you ever saw and
said, “My father has been sick for a long time but is better
now, and has promised to come to church just as soon as
he is able.” And back of him stood the other boy holding
a smaller boy by the hand. “Pastor,” he said, “this
is my younger brother, who has become a Christian, and
my father has been coming to church all winter.”</p>

<p>A bright, manly little fellow in my church in Pyeng
Yang had been a Christian only about a year when he
succeeded in getting his mother to come to church with
him. Soon after the mother decided to be a Christian,
this boy became very sick and his mother was very angry
at God about it. “See,” she said, “this is what I get for
being a Christian.” He plead with her not to feel that
way about it, and tried to get her to pray with him; but
she refused, saying, “I will never pray again.” One day,
just before he died, he held out his hands to her, saying,
“Mother, come pray with me now,” but she turned her
face away and sat down in a corner, and he began praying
alone in Korean, “Hanale Kai sin, uri abage,” “Our
Father who art in Heaven,” and, as he was praying, he
died. The next day his poor mother came to our house
and told my wife all about it and cried as if her heart
would break because she had let him die without praying
with him. I think God will let this boy know in some
way in heaven that his mother did repent after he went
away. (W. N. Blair, <cite>The Foreign Post</cite>, May, 1910.)</p>

<h4>TRAINING THE CHILDREN OF THE PACIFIC
ISLANDS</h4>

<p>In 1888, <abbr title="reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. Wyatt Gill, in a meeting in London,
gave a statement of his work as a missionary in the
Hervey Islands since 1851. “He spoke of the former
condition of the people, of their love of revenge and of
their human sacrifices, of the bloody feuds that existed
among them, of the rule, followed by all, of keeping alive
only two children in the family, and of the whole aspect
of their lives as something fearful; and stated that all this
had been changed through the influence of Christianity.
He remarked that to see a people who were once cannibals
partaking of the Lord’s Supper has been most delightful.
Looking around upon the assembly gathered for
this purpose he had seen the bread administered by one
to a man whose father that man had murdered, or the
reverse. He stated that the work of evangelization in
many of the South Pacific Islands had been done almost
entirely by natives trained in the Avarua School; that
hundreds of these natives have sacrificed their lives to
carry the Gospel to their brethren, and that sixty of Mr.
Gill’s own church have been killed while acting as missionaries.”

<h4>INFLUENCE OF A PICTURE CARD</h4>

<p>Once a month we give each girl a picture card. These
were sent to us by children in American Sunday-Schools,
and each time we explain to the child that the card was
sent by a little boy or girl in far-away America. One day
on our way home we stopped at a shop, and two of our
little girls seeing us drew near with the cards in hand.
A man sitting by asked one, a clever little girl, where she
got her picture. She didn’t say, “My teacher gave it
to me,” but answered, “A little girl in far-away America
sent it to me.” His next question, “Why did she send
<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a id="Page_256"></a></span>
it to you?” To which she replied, “Because she loves
me!” Then, as he continued to question her, she began
to explain the picture. It happened to be Christ delivering
the Sermon on the Mount. It was only a child-like
explanation given by a child of seven or eight years, but
the man was really interested. As we wended our way
I thought of the hundred and twenty-seven cards we had
given out that day, and the many hundreds that had been
given in days past, and wondered how many real Christian
sermons had been preached by little Hindu and Mohammedan
girls by means of these small cards. (<cite>Woman’s
Work</cite>, April, 1912, Bessie Lawton, Fatehgarh.)</p>

THE MOTHER AND THE CHRIST-CHILD</h2>

<p class="subhead">“Behold the handmaid of the Lord.”</p>

<div class="outline">
<p>It is suggested that at some convenient time
during the Christmas season a mass meeting
be held for the mothers of the community.
Special efforts should be made to gather <em>all</em>
mothers, as far as possible; carriages might be
sent for the old mothers, for special love and
deference is due to them; and arrangements should
be made for care of babies, so that young mothers
may be free to attend.</p>

<p>If so desired, the program may include selections
of stories and quotations from the foregoing
chapters, and some of the prayers may
be used. Let all Christian mothers gather to

<h3>PRAYER</h3>

<p>Oh Lord, our Heavenly Father, we pray for
Thy rich blessing upon this gathering of mothers,
and upon the mothers of this community. Grant
to each one of our children those blessings of
body, mind, and soul which Thou seest they
most need. Grant to each father and mother
the wisdom, love, and courage, and, above all, the
personal acquaintance with Thee that shall enable
them to train their children for useful, happy,
Christian manhood and womanhood, and to
love and serve Thee for time and for eternity.</p>

<p>We beseech Thee, in the name of the Holy
Child of Bethlehem, to remember our homes and
the homes of the whole earth with Thy Fatherly
blessing. Guard little children throughout the
world from sin and sorrow and suffering, from
cruel neglect and oppression, from growing up
in vice and ignorance. Stir the hearts of Thy
servants at this glad time of the Children’s
Festival, to take the knowledge of the blessed
Christ-Child to the remotest corners of the
earth, that all children may learn to know Him,
and may grow up into His likeness.</p>

<p>We ask it in the name of Thy Holy Child Jesus.
Amen.</p>

<p>What a significant fact it is that, of all religions,
Christianity is the only one which lays emphasis
on the childhood of its Founder! Mohammedan
tradition weaves the most marvelous and fantastic
tales about the infancy and childhood of
the man who founded it, though none of these are
mentioned in the Koran. But how different
are these extravagant and often disgusting stories,
from the wonderful Gospel story of the Christ-Child.</p>

<p>No other child ever born into this world has
had such honor done to the event of his birth, or
has been able to inspire in millions of hearts
through generation after generation the joy of
remembering others, the delight of expressing
love by gifts, the glory of “goodwill among men,”
that mark the Christmas time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="264"><a id="Page_264"></a></span>
Few of those who live in a Christian land can
realize the effect of the mere observance of the
Christmas festival on those who never heard of
Christ. Christmas Day, although of course not
celebrated by non-Christians, is nevertheless
called in India “the <em>great</em> day of the year,” by
thousands of Hindus and Mohammedans. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Badley of Lucknow, in commenting on the fact,
<span class="nowrap">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The heathen people of course do not celebrate
Christmas; they know that Christians do, however,
and this simple fact, so constantly observed,
causes them to think about the power of Christianity.
Many are led to ask, ‘Who was Christ?
What did He do? Why do the Christians observe
His birthday?’ These inquiries call forth
various answers, discussion follows, and thus the
whole nation with its many millions of people,
is thinking and talking about the world’s
Saviour.”</p>

<p>Would that every mother in America might have
a vision today of a Christless home in a Christless
land, and then of that home transformed,
and taking its share in the festival of the Christ-Child!
When once the spirit of the blessed Christ
has touched a heart or a home or a community,
there is a transformation. Is there any other
anniversary that inspires the blessed joy of
giving that belongs to the Christmas season?
The <cite>Missionary Link</cite> gives a sample of what
Christmas has come to mean to some Japanese
<span class="pagenum" title="265"><a id="Page_265"></a></span>
children in Kyoto, and the consequences of their
<span class="nowrap">celebration:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Last Christmas the children used the money
they had collected in Sunday-School to buy
charcoal for the poor. As they did not know
to whom they should give it, they asked the
policeman to give it to the poorest people he
knew. They did not hear any more about it for
some time, when one Sunday an old woman came
to Sunday-School, and asked if this was the place
where poor people were helped. She then
thanked the children for the charcoal, telling
them it had kept her warm most of the winter.
She told them she lived in a tiny room with
another old woman, and, although she worked very
hard sewing, she could only earn about three
cents a day. She had no money to buy charcoal
to keep her warm, and about Christmas time
thought she would throw herself into the river,
as she was of no use to any one. Just at that
time the children sent her the charcoal, so she
felt that some one really cared for her. She
helped in the heathen temple for a little while,
but said the people were so unkind to her she
could not stay. Now she is studying about Jesus,
and goes every week to the Sunday-School.”</p>

<p>If such effects follow when little heathen children
are taught the story of Christmas and its
significance, why, oh why, should not we mothers
send the beautiful message to every little
child in the world?</p>

 (Isabel Kimball Whiting in <cite>The Survey</cite>. By permission.)</p>

<p>Is it enough for us to plan that our own children
and those near and dear to us shall be made
happy by our Christmas tokens of love and
remembrance? Truly it is such a busy, rushing
time that even our regular church work must
<span class="pagenum" title="267"><a id="Page_267"></a></span>
often be set aside that the Christmas obligations
may be met. But a true mother heart is big
enough to take in more, and ever more, and the
blessing of growth is bestowed on each heart that
opens to admit new objects of love.</p>

<p>“Recently,” says the <cite>Outlook</cite>, “a tender,
gentle, refined woman who has identified herself
with those movements which seek to improve
the conditions of child life, said, ‘I have had a
new thought come to me that has made me accept
the loss of my little girl with patience, almost
with resignation. God never meant that a
woman should be the mother to just one little
girl. He meant that every woman should be
mother to every child in the world.’”</p>

<p>“How I wish I could give a Christmas present
to Jesus!” said a loving little girl, her eyes dancing
with Christmas joy as she surveyed the
small gifts, so long planned and carefully prepared
for her dear ones. For her the very essence
of Christmas was its expression in visible
tokens to those whom she loved. If we mothers
long to “give a Christmas present to Jesus,”
what could be more acceptable to Him, than the
dedication of an hour of this busy, happy Christmas
season to loving prayer and thought for
the mothers and children in our own community
and throughout the wide world? Thus shall we
be drawn near to the heart of the great Father,
and, if during this hour some angel messenger
whispers to our hearts of a special task which
<span class="pagenum" title="268"><a id="Page_268"></a></span>
He is willing to entrust to us, may we be ready
to answer with Mary of old,&mdash;“Behold the handmaid
of the Lord; be it unto me according to
thy word!”</p>

<p>What blessings shall we ask for the mothers of
the world? What do we need for ourselves?
Unselfish love, infinite patience, wisdom and
insight, tact and sympathy, health to bear the
daily strain, quiet nerves, a sense of humor that
smooths rough places, a sweet, strong cheerfulness,
a likeness to Christ that shall be reflected in
the lives of all the members of the household.
“According to the <em>riches</em> of His grace,” He is
waiting to bestow His blessings on the mother
hearts waiting here, before Him, and through
their intercession, on the mother hearts of the
world.</p>

<p>What blessings shall we ask for the children
of the world? The same that we ask for our
own as we kneel at their bedside, and our eyes
are dim with tears of yearning love, while we
pray that our darlings may be kept from harm
and accident, from all soul stains, that they
may “grow in wisdom and stature and in favor
with God and man.” Is there any blessing you
ask for your boy and girl that is not needed by
the other children of the world?</p>

<p>“Prayer is cheap,” some say, “it costs nothing
to say a prayer for missions.” <em>Real</em> prayer is
not cheap,&mdash;it costs the deepest, strongest
thought one can expend; it costs time; it costs
<span class="pagenum" title="269"><a id="Page_269"></a></span>
the willingness to help to answer one’s own prayers
in terms of interest and gifts and service.
In Christ’s name, then, let us pray, and let us
not rest nor be satisfied until every mother in
the world, clasping her child to her bosom, is
truly a holy mother, and every little child is a
holy child.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors repaired. Punctuation, spelling,
hyphenation and stylistic presentation
standardized when a predominant preference was found in this book.
Otherwise left as printed.</p>

<p>Where possible, illustrations have been moved next to the corresponding text, otherwise placed at section breaks.</p>

<p>In the original book, outlines of each chapter were printed on separate pages, preceded by chapter headings. These chapter headings were then repeated before the chapter text proper. In this electronic book the repeated chapter headings are not preserved.</p>

<p>For less common abbreviations and Roman numerals, title attributes
have been provided for the convenience of screenreader users.</p>

<p>Page 80, ‘Tyer’ changed to ‘<a href="#tn_1">Iyer</a>’ (Mr. Justice Moothoswami Iyer).</p>

<p>Footnote 34, ‘Caffin’ changed to ‘<a href="#tn_2">Coffin</a>’ (“On the Education of Backward Races,” E. W. Coffin).</p>

<p>Page 134, ‘plead’ changed to ‘<a href="#tn_3">pleaded</a>’ (Earnestly he
pleaded with the missionaries).</p>

<p>Page 272, ‘American’ changed to ‘<a href="#tn_7">Armenian</a>’ (Orphans, Armenian massacre).</p>

<p>On page 231, there is an orphaned double quotation mark after ‘<a href="#tn_8">babyhood</a>’. The opening mark
should probably be before ‘Women spoke from the platform’ etc.</p>
